The place is amazingly clean inside and out (something to be proud of props to clean) and the staff are friendly if you have any questions they were eager to respond. So what I read alot about the Geno's and Pats experience is that folks are expecting a cheesesteak epiphany because these places get alot of build up from locals and the expectation level is beyond real. Lets start with a cheesesteak being a very simple sandwich with basic ingredients. How you put the pieces together largely determines the outcome. Geno's has a very good product and we are lucky to have so many steak choices in Philly. For me I like to embrace that diversity and when introducing a newcomer, let them find which style of cheesesteak they like. Geno's is good and so are others, i have my favorite and hope you find yours. This is a great place to start your journey to steak nirvana.

The whole sandwich was cold and was a waste of my money. I couldn't even take a decent picture to put up with my yelp review. It looked horrible too. There was grease dripping at the end of my sandwich and the grease was getting hard and becoming a clear white substance as it got colder and colder. Therefore, I didn't even want to go over to Pat's to try another disgusting cheese steak, but I'm glad that last minute I went over to Pat's to give them a try!

The steak was greasy, the bread was hard, and the price was ridiculous for the finished product. Pat's was superior to this shop.

6166,11042,3345,1.0,1,2015-01-02,"Time of visit: December 29, 2014 @ approx. 10:30pm Deserves no stars because: Disgusting + Terrible Service Gets 1 star because: Yelp doesnt do half -stars and the potato salad saved the night a LITTLE BIT. This review may differ from other positive reviews because of different restaurant servers and time of eating but this is what I experienced. Fellow Yelpers, take this review with care on your next trip there and avoid the circumstances that are similar to ours. I dont like to waste my time writing but I only write if something got way out of hand. This place was one of them...I HAVE TO LET THE PEOPLE KNOW. Went to Morgan's after a Net's game. Initially wanted to get Dino BBQ but upon arriving there, we found out they didn't have any major meat players (brisket, ribs) so we took a chance and trekked to Morgan's feeling that they would have more selection because they close an hour later than Dino..what a MISTAKE. THEY HAD LESS... Manager of Morgan's, if you actually go on Yelp to read about your restaurant, let me begin by saying that by the end of the night, we still did not know who our server was... There were 2 women rotating with service at our table (why?)... We got our water from one woman, got orders taken from another, and was served by the former. That is not even the lowlight of the night. First off, one server was drinking alcohol while on her shift. She was drinking with what seemed to be her friends who were in to visit. Only helped us reluctantly when her FRIENDS POINTED IT OUT. IMAGINE!? EVEN HER FRIENDS HAD MORE OF AN IDEA TO HELP A PATRON. HER FRIENDS SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HOME THE EARNINGS... Second, the other server was a drama queen who was rather rude and would ignore patrons on purpose, pretending not to have seen an outstretched hand asking for assistance. Im not one to bash on people, but that is quite rude that she decided for herself when and whether she would come over and provide help. What was even ruder was she called out the table next to us when they were about to leave with such attitude. She said in a loud voice, ""sorry I dont know if you guys know, but we didnt include gratuity.."" One of the patrons opened the check holder and showed that they had indeed left the tip. All the server did was say dryly, ""thanks."" That left such a sour taste in my mouth. How rude do you have to be to do that? Who's doing the hiring in this restaurant? Where was the apology at least? Holy Toledo, maybe the person who hired those ladies has an agenda with the boss.. I dont know, Im just saying. You dont hurt your business like that by hiring people like those 2. That night, Morgan's did not have the main meat players as well. Even when they closed at 12... Ok fine, understandable if all Morgan's does is serve alcohol and whatever but do try to let people know that maybe the kitchen would close at a certain time and not serve the main course meat.. We ended up getting macaroni and cheese with potato salad and a sausage. Here is the food breakdown: Both Mac and Cheese (got the mushroom and chicken with avocado) were warm. Mac and Cheese should be hot and gooey. The cheese should be elastic right? BZZZ wrong. It just detached faster than a retina after an eye gouge.... Even if it is late at night, I expect to get my money's worth of food quality. Do you agree? Dont use closing time as an excuse. If you do, you might as well offer a late night discount. The potato salad was the only good thing, know why? Because it's the ONLY thing that needed to be refrigerated. Meaning you cant really screw it up so long as it is in cold air... I did not forget about the pork sausage. Ready for this? Drier than the desert. Obviously it's been kept in the kitchen for quite some time. Absolutely terrible. Eating it made me thirsty and that is no exaggeration. And here is the most HEINOUS crime that night. Ms Drama Queen tried to play us for fools when we called for the check. Let me turn back the clock to let you fellow readers know the situation. We ordered the lean brisket because Ms Drinks on the Job told us that that is the only brisket they had left. Fine, all good in the neighborhood like Mr Rogers. After the order was placed, Ms Drama Queen comes over and tells us that they actually ran out of brisket. Ok FINE. I told her we will cancel the brisket and order the drier than hippo skin sausage. She said ok. Back to the HEINOUS crime. Ms Drama Queen gave us the check and the brisket was there... You, the reader might say, it could be an accident. Well.. I dont think so.. Why was the sausage order listed above the brisket?.. That bugs me more than a fly to an elephant. Boy what a scheme. Unbelievable. Look, Im not saying to not eat at this place. Just please NEVER GO AT NIGHT AFTER 10.. I left only 6% tip because tips are not a privilege. It is earned with hard and respectful work. It is supposed to reflect the quality of work you are doing. Just me, but Im not returning. And others will hear about this

I ordered the Cheesesteak Egg Rolls and my girlfriend ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese. For me, I was in love with the Egg Rolls right away, and they come with Sriracha Ketchup!

Lamb shank tasted like typical braised beef, branzino needed some more herbs and salt, salmon was very bland, lamb chops were good. The appetizers actually rated better than the entrees.

A beautiful Mediterranean-themed interior, full with a predominantly blue/white color scheme,  terra-cotta pots hanging from the ceiling, and fresh floral accents, I was immediately transported to an elegant, foreign land. I was fortunate enough to indulge in the following: ~saganaki tou merakli ~haloumi sote me stafylia kai tsipouro ~piperia gemisti me kafteri feta ~greek salad All dishes were done beautifully (even the starter bread with hummus-like dip was great), the first two being slightly tastier than the last two dishes. The haloumi cheese was cooked perfectly, and the thick slabs satiated my craving immediately. The three cheeses melted in a pot were rich and indulgent, and paired with the starter bread were unbelievably mouth-watering. The feta and red peppers dish (third on the list) was great, but not as rich in flavor as I'd hoped it would be. The greens were nothing too special- I'd opt for the heavier sounding dishes because I feel like that is where their specialties truly lie. Prices were average- not too steep but not too cheap either. It's a perfect place for plate-sharing and experimentation. Go big, or go home-- opt for the cheesy or elaborate dishes and stay away from the healthier menu options like the salads. It'll be an elevated experience to remember!

8801,13407,69,2.0,1,2015-01-02,"I was really looking forward to coming and enjoying this new hot spot in South Williamsburg not only because of all the great reviews, but I used to live in the South and love love LOVE great biscuits. Unfortunately, my experience was sub-par. I came on NYE in the afternoon with a long time industry friend. We wanted to catch up and have some great food ( I had previously looked at the menu prior to coming.) When we got to the table, it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to come to the table. I was getting hungry, but was okay because the ambiance seemed nice and my friend was catching up with me. The waitress came to the table and brought a water bottle, but did not bring glasses. WE asked for coffee and ordered some appetizers immediately. She seemed perplexed and not happy to be in the cafe. The place was about half-full at this time, and the owner seemed to be there, but was only mildly helping. We had some veggies brought to the table as a welcome which was nice, but the veggies were all wilted and looked like they were rotting. We thought the color meant that they were pickled, but they definitely were not. The dip was very nice though. We had to ask for water glasses. The deviled eggs were awesome and different- which was nice. The fried green tomatoes were just blah, and the waitress gave us a suggestion to get a couple biscuits to share. I would not recommend sharing because when they came to the table the biscuits are really made for individuals and hard to cut. I ate the biscuits quickly because I was hungry, but they were not very good. I couldn't taste the ingredients in the biscuits. They also put like a grocery store mesculin mix on the biscuit which made it wilt and soggy. I hate when chefs put that on warm sandwiches- who thinks that tastes good?! Also, the food is prefaced that it is made by Texans, which is very different from Georgia, where I lived. The flavors are more savory and less sweet, salty, and spicy. I even did not like the honey mustard, and I love ALL mustard. The coleslaw that accompanied the meal was truly gross and tasteless. Very disappointing. When we were eating, the waitress had a couple come in, and she seemed mildly busy, but she was very intense with them saying something like, ""I'm busy right now. I'll be there in a second, okay?!"" She even made a party of three create their own table because the owner and waitress lacked communication to help set a table up for them. I'm not trying to get on the waitress, but it made the experience uncomfortable. Also, I despise having to pay with an iPad at the table. I have to give my tip there, and hand it right back to the waitress, and although I never give under 20% for service, I couldn't justify giving more than 17% today. Why do people in this industry think this is a good thing? The cafe is slow and comfortable. no need to rush paying at the table because it appears convenient to the guest. I'm willing to give this place another chance, but I'm completely baffled as to why people feel this place is amazing.

We shared the cold mezze taster and brochette platter.  Both were delicious!  Mushroom/truffle oil pizza was also amazing.  You can't really go wrong with any of the mezzes, and we especially liked that the menu is very vegetarian friendly.  Favorites were stuffed peppers, roasted eggplant and grilled portabella. I'm definitely keeping this place bookmarked.  Low lit setting makes it good for dates, but also ideal for small groups of friends too.  Lastly, bonus points for being in a pretty cool part of Nolita with great bars and shops nearby.

I ate with 4 other people family style and it worked out very very well. On top of the sigsig, pork belly adobo, mussels, baby back ribs, and the halo halo for dessert. For the most part, the food was very basic; it tasted a lot like traditional chinese food (mostly the pork belly & skin) and I wasn't very impressed with it. The space is also huge, but gives off a weird vibe because of the $15/all you can drink beer. Saw a lot of drunk people wandering around mixed with a few dates and white collar business-man.

We started with chicharron, which I hadn't had since my trip to Manila and it was as delicious as I remember, crispy, sally, flavorful.  The perfect compliment to a good beer.  They had some good selections and some different beers.  I of course had to get a San Miguel, its not the best beer in the world, but reminds me of sitting on the beaches of Boracay as its the beer that is everywhere in the Philippines.  They also have an all you can drink keg which is a good idea, but none of us partaked as it was knew it would be a long night with several more stops.  My friend had some cocktails that she raved about us well. Now onto the food.  We basically shared a bunch of small dishes, starting with salads.  We got the green mango salad, pork belly adobo, and pork jowl.  They were all really good and actually all complimented each other.  I was least excited about the green mango salad, however this may have been my favorite and it was nice to have something light, fresh, and sweet to balance out the other dishes.  I simply love adobo and generally love pork belly, so this was a match made in heaven.  The pork belly is soft, meaty, and luxurious.  The adobo was as it should be complex with punches of soy and vinegar.  It balances great with the fatty pork belly.  Finally the pork jowl.  It was tender and full of pork flavor.  I am not a  huge fan of brussel sprouts but this and the fish sauce brightened it up and lifted what could have been a heavy dish.  We thought about ordering another dish, but this left us full and satisfied.

For the time I wanted a lunch take out before I headed to class, I decided to go inside to order and wait for my food since I didn't have a take out menu stashed in the pocket of my car door (it wouldn't fit anyway... already have too many take out menus in there as it is).  The staff was really great, I was given the full restaurant menu to use for takeout and was even given a glass of water while I waited for my banh mi and bubble tea. The last time I went was for a holiday luncheon with the agency I'm currently interning at (which consisted of me and the only two staff). Once again service was great, the staff checked on us regularly and gave us as much time as we needed to decide on what we wanted to order. We ordered the shrimp and chicken spring rolls to split, while I got the number 24: pho beef noodle soup with beef ball and tendon.  The noodle soup was delicious; the broth was not overly salted, but that might be because we were having lunch early in the day.  The spring rolls were delicious; ingredients in the rolls were nice and fresh. The atmosphere of the restaurant is pleasant and relaxing.  For some reason or another, we were all fascinated by the decoration near the entrance of the restaurant and that the little water display was loud for its size... that's when we realized at that point we all ran out of things to talk about and it was time to head back to the office.

The Chicken Empanadas were probably the best I've ever had - filled with juicy and flavorful pieces of chicken. The Camarones Cuzco was just heavenly, with plenty of shrimp, delicious rice, and a silky aji amarillo garlic sauce, topped with pickled red onions. We also had the Matador Combo ($38) which can easily feed 2-4 people. It came with a whole Peruvian style roasted chicken, a side of crispy tostones, rice and beans, an avocado salad, and Franks and fries - all very delicious (especially with their special green sauce).

The red cab was decent enough and ....wait for it, $3.  I then ordered [from the dinner menu] a lovely tri-colore salada with arugula, sliced cherry tomato, gorgonzola, endives in a light vinegrette. Delicioso. A great spot for pre-theatre. My only disappointment was the baby artichoke. They say it is wood-grilled but there was no grill taste; it was fried in bread crumbs. The  baby artichokes were tender but too greasy. Not a good match for me. All and all, however, a really nice ITALIAN BISTRO in the heart of Downtown Hartford. I would go back again.

We started with the cheesy garlic bread (a must have) - I had linguine with clams and I am CERTAIN the pasta is homemade. Absolutely delicious. Martinis are not on the menu, however, when I asked for one the bartender was happy to make one - and made one of the best pomegranate Martinis I have ever had!!! Dessert - yum!!!

Food: Small portions (meaning, just right!) of really fresh and delicious offerings.  I had the Veggie Benedict which replaced the english muffin with a grilled tomato, the ham was replaced with slices of avocado and the usual egg and sauce were on top of that. Served with some crispy home fries (a bit on the lukewarm side, though).  My partner had the omelet with spinach and avocado.  Everything was just about perfect. I felt like I had some room left at the end of the meal so decided to order a freshly squeezed juice to go.  I went with the Hangover Helper (even though I wasn't rocking a hangover) which is carrot, beet, apple, ginger, lime and some cayenne.  The juice was really good but I think I had it too soon after my meal.  I was just way too full and had a stomachache all day.  My fault for mixing all that goodness at one time.  My partner also had a juice (the Energy Boost) and he was fine.  So the stomachache was of my own doing and no reflection on quality of food served.

I also got a chance to taste the pulled pork sandwich and the tomato soup.  The tomato soup was very good as well (and I'm not usually a big fan of tomato soup), I like the idea of using a part of a grilled cheese sandwich as a crouton.  The soup was creamy, but not overly so, and well spiced.  The pulled pork was okay.  A messy sandwich with very sauce-y pulled pork lacking any real smoke flavor.  Heavy on the barbecue sauce.  I didn't particularly like the fries, I would try to substitute them for one of the other sides if I was getting a sandwich here.

This place, however, requires a 2 hour wait so something must be special. So, yes to the best blueberry pancake I ever had hands down. Their fresh made maple syrup coating those fluffy, thick, and warm pancakes is welcoming to the belly. However, not worth my 2 hours. French toast is a pretty close competitor to the pancake. Although not raved about in other Yelp reviews, I do enjoy them. Too many bananas though. YES, the lobster egg benedict. Oh, what expectations I had. The biscuit holding these eggs benny was soaked up with sauce, which made it soggy and kinda gross. The hollandaise sauce did no justice but I probably don't like that sauce to begin with. Eggs were cooked perfectly though. Lobster was the best part no doubt. Lastly, the farmer's plate looks just plain normal-- something you can get at a regular diner so I would avoid that. Ambiance: Pretty crowded in here. Tables are close together so try not to knock anything over from your neighbor's table when you get up. It's moderately noisy in here but you can still hear your friends across the table from you. Bathroom is a bit dirty but they do have Purell in there. CASH ONLY! Service: Friendly staff. Didn't rush my table when we were figuring out what to get even if it's crowded. The Bottom Line: Okay, I probably wouldn't wait 2 hours to come here again. On a Sunday afternoon around 2pm is your best bet for getting seats quick. FOR FOOD, GET PANCAKE, WAFFLE OR FRENCH TOAST AND DIP IT IN THAT MAPLE SYRUP!

Although I do think they can give you more maple butter because its the only syrup that comes with those fluffly pancakes. I think they charge for more, $2. Thats awful. For an appetizer I ordered the fried green tomatoes. They were underwhelming. I expected much more flavor and depth. They were just plain and tasted like pickles.

Blueberry Pancakes: PROS -i think i had a foodgasm in my mouth, DRp actually commented on the look on my face, that first bite was that good. -super fluffy, super filling CONS -for some reason i wanted more blueberries -this may NOT be an actual con, but DRp and I could NOT finish the pancakes.  I think we only managed to eat about 75% of it.  First time I've actually felt like there was too much food. ""Maple"" Bacon: PROS -it's bacon -super crispy -half pack pretty much: so much bacon!  We couldn't even finish it. CONS -this ain't no maple bacon.  There is bacon, and then there is ""maple"" bacon where you can actually taste the infusion of maple syrup permeating the saltiness of the meat.  I didn't even taste the ""brown sugar"" that it supposedly coats the bacon in.  So sad.

Pat's, Geno's, etc etc).  I have to say Sonny's is quite excellent (without the outward racial/SES slurs demonstrated at Pats or Genos. They use excellent fresh cuts of beef and slice right in house. We ordered our cheese steaks with grilled onions (my fiance ordered the one with onions, lettuce, and tomato as well) and they were made promptly. The only change I would make is to have gone with my gut and ordered cheese whiz instead of the provolone. The steak wasn't fatty or greasy (which was good) so I think I needed that extra ""sauciness"" that comes with whiz that just doesn't happen with fresh provolone. Their fries were just ehhh but you can definitely tell that people come for the cheese steaks not the fries. The fries, for whatever reason, were not piling hot as expected since the customer line was long and moving fast I figured the fries would be served hot and fresh. But as a side note, I am a huge fries person; don't let that deter you from trying this place out! The place was absolutely packed so we could not get a table (very little seating) but we didn't mind because we parked across the street and just ate in our car. Regardless, the line was efficient and moved quickly so it was not a problem at all for us to order and quickly get our food.

The overall ambiance and decor is great. It has an intimate yet comfortable feel to it. We were actually seated in the lower room, which felt almost like a wine cellar. I can see how some might not like this, but I thought it added even more to the experience. The wine list is extensive and has great options. I tried a flight of reds as well as a glass afterwards and they were all very good. Good selection from all around the globe, with a focus on Italian of course. The food was delicious. We had a ricotta and honey bruschette that was outstanding - highly recommend this if you're looking to try one. Delicious flavor! We also tried the truffle polenta appetizer - very good also but more rich than even I though it would be. We had two pasta entrees, the fettuccine with shrimp and zucchini and the cavatelli pesto. Again, both were absolutely delicious. The shrimp were cooked just right and had delicious flavor, and the cavatelli tasted as if it were just made. The only down side to the experience would be the tight seating throughout the restaurat - you're really on top of other tables. But this is true of many and more places of course. Overall, a really great experience and delicious meal - will return again for sure.

It doesn't matter what you ask for, it's always rare. The bigger problem is chicken.

The place is a bit small, but set up well. The service is phenomenal. We had a party of 6 and sat in the high booth table. We definitely overstayed our welcome, but we did not feel rushed out by the lady behind the counter. I got the original burger and bacon jam fries. The bacon jam fries were tasty. The original burger was okay. It took a while for me to find the cheese, but once I got to the cheesy goodness - I was a happy customer. Two qualms I did have with the burgers: 1. The patty was cooked a little more than what I am used to, but that is probably how they get the cheese to melt inside so that's understandable. 2. The bread was too flakey and a bit too dry. I think I got the brioche bun. I'm going to try the potato bread next time because... How can you ever go wrong with potato bread?

24617,26549,168,3.0,1,2015-01-06,"Really good and generous portion of fries, good buns. And the bacon jam is so very delicious. I had two issues, and one was kind of a big one: I thought the burger itself had a very strange pasty texture, as if the meat was ground too finely. It just wasn't pleasant to eat. My husband felt the same way and also felt that the burger was on the small side. For that price, he'd like to be sated. I didn't have an issue with the size. I wasn't stuffed but wasn't hungry afterwards. Kind of the perfect size for me. The other issue is minor. We went in the evening and the space was very dark. Not in a warm cozy inviting way, but like a ""we're trying to save on the electric bill,"" or ""we're closing soon,"" even though they weren't. I really want to love this place, especially since Elevation Burger closed. I love that this is grass-fed beef and there's definitely an effort to use high quality ingredients. I'll give it another try to see if the texture was a one-time issue, especially since no one else has mentioned it.

Baby kale with cauliflower hummus topped with red quinoa, tomatoes, onion, watermelon radish and alfalfa got me feelin some type of way!

It was totally empty except for us, so we sat right at the counter. Menus and waters were passed around and we chose the salsa and chips, beef taco and chicken taco. So. Chips were okay. I'm a BIG BIG lover of tortilla chips, and these weren't bad! I don't think they are homemade, but they did a good job of being a delivery device for the salsa. Salsa was pretty good, pretty watery. But the flavors were there so okay! Tacos arrive. Beef taco was really good! It was really large for a standard taco for only a few bucks, filled with an ample amount of meat, cheese and diced veggies. Much like the salsa, the taco was pretty watery. Actually, a little too watery. It made for a super messy situation, which was hard to control. But you know, I can't stop won't stop, so I plowed through that taco with vigor as sauce dripped down my hands and cheek. Definitely a more ""Americanized"" version of a beef taco, with shredded american cheese and ground beef. The chicken was pretty good, nothing too crazy. Again, watery! I think it's best to stick to the beef tacos. Definitely the star here. I will say, the staff was friendly, but when you sit at the counter, you can see them prepare the tacos and salsa, ect. It's a little off-putting because everything is in enormous vats, who knows how long that salsa has been sitting there? What about the beef? Listen, I wasn't born yesterday. I know most restaurants have food sitting in massive plastic containers, ready for plating. But I don't want to look at it, ya know? I want a little smoke and mirrors. So that wasn't too great. But the beef taco was worth returning for! I think this is a late night destination win. You know, so you can watch them prepare your tacos with your beer goggles on.

The coffee is served very regularly, and they are not pushy at all about getting you out of the place while you enjoy a cup of coffee after your meal. I had a pastrami reuben with a side of potato salad and it was quite excellent. The reuben was very thick, the meat was excellent, and the bread didn't taste as if the pan was overly buttered, which is always a plus for me. I was especially impressed with the potato salad. It had a variety of different flavors and ingredients and they were very generous with the portion. The staff was amazingly friendly and attentive, and not just for a diner.

Probably to turn over the seat faster is my guess. We came here twice. Once at the counter and another time at the tables. It's much more enjoyable to eat at a table. I tried a chicken meatball dip style soba the first time and soup noodle bowl the next time. There are two sizes, small and large...the large is more noodles/carbs. The problem I feel is the meat in the soup runs out before the noodles run out so your left eating a lot of noodles. It's almost all carbs. The broth is light and not greasy. I just got tired of the noodles after a little bit. I couldn't finish just the broth and noodles without anything else to go with it. I gave it to my boyfriend and he happily finished it for me. I tasted the ginger in the meatballs. I am not a big ginger fan but that is a personal preference. The meatballs are light and I enjoyed it. I wish there was just a bit more meatballs. The flame under the dip soup evaporates the liquid too fast and I had to ask for extra water (?) before the broth really evaporated too fast. The extra liquid didn't come fast enough though. I like the warm soba better because it feels like it warms your soul when it's cold outside. Would I come back....if I was in the neighborhood, maybe. It's good to at least try once though.

It's definitely decent- ingredients are fresh, and everything is prepared before your eyes- but nothing extraordinary. The broth is light and feels healthier, so ramen-lovers who are looking for a lighter alternative, this is for you. But you can just add water to any good broth and achieve the same effect, right? And when I order something and suspect that it was good before they added water, I'm not impressed. When I seek out ramen, I want a complicated and deep broth, fatty, savory, and rich. The appetizers here are kind of silly too.

None of the other places were any good, but this place is up to par with any other real Italian deli around. And there fresh Mozzarella might be better than the other two guys in town. They have lots of daily hot foods you can take home and use real Italian cold cuts. And all the Italian groceries you could need.  One issue I have with them is that they have to learn how to make a sandwich in less time than it takes for me to read Moby Dick. . I was the only person being helped by this particular lady but it still took her about 10 minutes to make me two simple sandwiches, in a world where the guy down the block does the same thing for you in 2 minutes this will give me second thoughts about going back if I'm in a rush, which we always are. Another issue I had is that I bought some nutella that turned out to be expired by over 9 months, I never brought it back or told them about it, I'm sure they would have replaced if I did. I just don't want to have to look at all the expiration dates before I buy something, I'm trusting the vender does that before putting something out.   That being said I'm very happy this place is around and doing well so now I have on other option to get some great Italian deli food. I might go there right now and get a nice sandwich.

They had a kettle of black tea on the table as soon as we sat down. They also had a multitude of sauces, which Pierre says is important in informing our Austin pho choices. I was terrified of eating raw meat. I specifically asked Pierre how raw my beef would be, and he assured me that the broth would cook it. This is honestly what has held me back from pho in Austin so far. Guess what y'all: that broth will cook your goddamn beef! Shit was delicious. I love pho.

Park Slope has a slew of decent mom and pop eateries and a small handful of delicious, inventive restaurants. Juventino is definitely the latter. A Michelin-recommended restaurant, Juventino serves an interesting blend of Mexican, American and British fare. And it's all quite lovely. In the mood for sweet? Go for the pancakes. They're fluffy and decadent. Simple enough. Is a savory dish more appealing? Then you will surely want to try the Huaraches de Carne. This bad boy is a thick corn tortilla layered with crushed black beans, topped with arugula, goat cheese, oaxaca cheese, chipotle and a delicious braised chicken in a spicy tinga sauce. It is superb! I also recommend the mimosas. They oddly provide enough bubbly for almost 2 glasses of fizzy happiness. I'm partial to the Passion Fruit. Other highlights include the shrimp and polenta, the baked eggs and the fabulous biscuits with sausage espelette gravy. Yum!

Five minutes later they sat a group on the other side of us with an infant. During brunch the waiter tried to take the plate from the person next to me.

My boyfriend and I moved to the neighborhood in October, and first happened upon this after passing their storefront and seeing a sign for happy hour oysters and $2 tacos. I live for oysters and also work at an oyster restaurant, so I had to check it out. Patio was wonderful, the place was surprisingly near empty. I guess on weekdays in Park Slope happy hour is a bit barren most places. The place had a wildly delicious looking menu, so we decided to come here for my birthday at the end of October. The place was very quiet, but the staff was wonderfully attentive and accommodating. This is when we met Ermira. She is unbelievably sweet, knowledgeable, and all around a great server. And this is coming from someone who's served for around ten years. She heard it was my birthday, and we got a complimentary amuse, and a dessert with port! Such a treat. We left high on food and great vibes. We came back for brunch with my family from Jersey, and while she wasn't there, the service was great. We made sure to make reservations a week in advance, since there were seven of us for Saturday brunch. GREAT brunch food. But really, nothing compares to their service and food at dinner time. We THEN had to come back for my boyfriend's birthday, and she remembered us! Again, there were few tables in the place, and we sat in our same spot. Same treatment as last time, she hooked us UP. This is why I always say, treat your servers very well, and they will return the favor. It's not that hard of a concept to understand, but so few in this city get it. Just last week we came again because my sister and her fiance were in town. She remembered our names, was her super cheerful, effervescent self, and my family loved her. THEN, with all of us just having happy hour oysters, tacos, and a couple appetizers with a couple drinks, she STILL hooks us up with an amuse and a dessert.  I have never left this place feeling anything less than elated. Ermira is amazing. The food is SENSATIONAL, and easily one of our favorite restaurants in the city right now, but I find myself thinking; if not for her infectious attitude and amazing service, would I still think this is one of the best spots? Who knows, but I will not stop coming here for as long as she works here. :]

I'm the type of customer who likes to ask a bunch of questions about the food/drink before ordering and they were very patient with me. Our food came out on time. Thank you Victor, Almira, Juned and Freddy! Food and Beverage - My husband and I  have passed by this place a few times while running errands and they were always packed. But last weekend we finally decided to give it a go. We were there from brunch till dinner time. I had a few glasses of delicious and fruity red wine and hubby had a few bottles of San Miguel beer. His beer was full bodied but not too heavy with a malty caramel flavor --Yum! For starters we got the Ensalada Grande. The serving was generous. Perfect for two people. The dressing wasn't overpowering but complimented the vegetables well. They gave us a complimentary appetizer to start - roasted garlic and chips which  was also delicious. We also took advantage of their $1.00 oyster special. They have a long list of oysters available! The oysters came with 2 different sauces but I like to eat mine with a simple vinegar with garlic so they gave me a small saucer plate of it. Their oysters were fresh and  moderately sweet which I loved! We also got the Paletitas De Pollo which came with blue cheese and creamed potatoes. Now, to me when someone says chicken wings, I would normally expect a typical looking bunch of chicken wings. Paletitas De Pollo looked like lollipops. But don't let it fool you because to my surprise, it was meaty and tasty! It was so good I didn't even ask for hot sauce. It went well with the creamed potatoes. While we were waiting for our  main course, they gave us another complimentary appetizer :) One for me and one for my husband. My husband is a vegetarian and they didn't have a lot of vegetarian options. Hubby asked if they could make him some vegetarian tacos and he enjoyed them!  He found them very fresh and tasty. As for me, I ordered the Panza De Puerco. OH. MY. GUH.... It was sooooo good! Crispy on the outside and ""melts in your mouth"" on the inside. It was 'that' good. I had it with a side order of rice. We also got  a side order of roasted potatoes and wild mushrooms. For dessert, we ordered their chocolate souffle. Unfortunately, it was really dry and didn't have a lot of taste. But you know what made up for it? They knew we didn't enjoy it and they didn't let us pay for it. We said we'd pay for it but they still took it off the bill. That was nice. We really appreciated it!

Probably some of the best pizza I have had at a bar so far. Sometimes me and my sister will go out of our way and pick up a pie from there just for the hell of it. Nice thin crust, not too shabby! Crowd seems kind of rowdy sometimes. I was at friends house in the area so we walked for a beer on New Years eve. A bearded monolith and a mother f**ker who looked like a jacked Charlie Chapplin I thought were gonna start a fight. But then again there were some other patrons egging them on so I suppose they had a right to be a little angry. Nothing super serious, just schoolyard shit. No fight broke out but be forewarned don't go to any bar and act a fool, especially to those bigger than you. I'm a lover not a fighter and don't egg on people that can kick my ass so I never had that problem. Other issue is the volume of the music. Live bands and loud jukebox make conversation impossible.

So much so that had I paid for the bill which was generously covered by our host, I would not have left a tip. The only thing that tasted any good were the whole bellied fried clam starters. They were lightly breaded and tender. Salmon platter was tasteless and dry. No cocktail sauce was offered with the shrimp. The scallops were tiny and definitely not fresh as were the shrimp covering the scallops . The shrimp were dried out and tough to chew. Dessert consisted of an Amaretto Pie that tasted like a store bought freezer vanilla pudding pie, not even a hint of Amaretto there at all. When we asked for coffee we incurred a long wait with 1 creamer each and no refills. They skimped on all condiments like butter, sour cream and tarter sauce but they were very generous with the coleslaw which had a funny after taste. Sticker shock came over our host who graciously paid the bill totally over 115.00 and he reluctantly left a tip. Definitely not a pleasant experience. Would not recommend this place to anyone. Most restaurants would at least recognize a birthday recipient in some way. Not this place. Lesson learned?

The chef must really like pepper or seems to have never heard of any other spice or seasoning because, quite literally, everything I have ever eaten here is completely bland except for the overwhelming pepper flavor. The last thing I ate at Caseus was called on the menu ""Strip Steak"" with ""Rice."" It was strange that when I asked if I could have the steak medium rare the waitress told me it only came well done. I ended up getting a bowl full of rice and little pieces of carrots and what seemed to be the tiny remains of what was once some sort of steak. The whole thing was astonishingly tasteless except, of course, the overwhelming flavor of pepper. The dish explains why the term ""Doggy Bag"" came into existence because it was barely edible even for an animal. I tried to feed it to my dog, but even he seemed disinterested.   Secondly, most other items on the menu are a sort of mishmash of options a twelve year old might assemble. Grilled cheese, mac and cheese, cheese burger, and the occasional menu ""special,"" the very creative, ""steak and cheese hot pocket"" (I'm not making this up) which sounded like something I ate at 2am when I was a freshman in college and regretted it.   I really don't get the hype about this place.

When I went to sit down, she told me they were ""actually closed"". Oh well, I won't be back. Wish I'd asked to return the cup of tea. It was a stale chamomile bag and hardly worth drinking without a place to sit and read my book.  Only in New York will people sell you a cup of tea before they tell you they're closed!

Our waters were refilled quickly and the waitress and manager both came over regularly to see how we were doing.

So far, so good. We had 4 orders of BbQ in addition to a bevy of other dishes, all of which came out relatively quickly. After that, whether through lack of manpower or just plain bad service, we were left on our own. We had to very aggressively flag down someone to replace our charred and smoking grill, not once but three times, and were essentially left to cook our own order. We couldn't decide if it was lack of attention due to being second-gen asians (who are sometimes second class customers in korean restaurants) or overall incompetence. I did bring it to the attention of someone who seemed to be a manager or owner, and she  apologized and promised to improve next time. That said she still didn't send anyone to our table, where another grill was charred and smoking. In the end, the food was very tasty, and came out fast. But for the price of the meal, the service was plain bad, whether through lack of manpower or bad planning. Definitely worth another visit, but service desperately needs to improve.

Previously I have enjoyed coming to eat here because the quality of the ingredients and the service. Overall, our meal was great. I enjoyed the sushi & sashimi combo as the fish was perfectly fresh. My favorite part was the marinated escala. My husband enjoyed the special gyu don with local marinated thinly sliced beef, rice, and egg. We had a high end sake in carafe, which was nice and smooth. We ordered a special, the shabu shabu as an appetizer. It came out in a metal pot in top of a elegant clay holder with a sterno. The meat was thinly sliced and wonderful when cooked in a broth with wakame, green onions, etc. The cooks or waitress forgot the sesame sauce to go with this dish and were surprised that we wanted to eat the broth, which is a traditional way of eating shabu shabu. Tonight the service was slow from the kitchen and we can see many patrons food was delayed. Sadly, in spite of the food being good the long delayed service muddled our experience. The cost would have been worth it cause of the food but the service and poor appetizer kind of took the value out of the experience there.

My husband had the shrimp bisque followed by the fish and chips. He loved both. I tried a taste of the bisque and it was great: rich seafood flavor. The fish and chips came with a garnish of pickled shaved Brussels sprouts that was delicious but not necessarily pretty to look at--it looked unintentionally wilted, but tasted great. I started with a squash and arugula salad. Then had the shrimp and grits from the starters menu as my main dish. At only $10, this is a serious deal compared to other menu items.  There was enough food to call it a small entree. (Three large shrimp). The grits were smooth and cheesy---much better than I make at home! The dessert menu was short, but the chocolate bread pudding I had was fantastic and my husband liked his flourless cake. Our waitress was great: efficient and knowledgeable. Other front-of-house stuff was a little odd. When we arrived, there was nobody at the hostess station so we waited there until someone appeared from the back. I think there's very little staff so they double-duty a bit, but it would be nice if that worked a bit more seamlessly. All in all, a nice meal and it's great to see small chef-owned businesses do well, so go eat there!

For New Jersey, do NOT expect this to be the typical dive diners that we have peppered all over our great state. This place is more high-class and expensive. I don't even know what qualifies it as a diner, other than it's outward, general appearance. Nothing on the menu gave it a diner feel. AT ALL. Once you get over that, the place is great. Very clean, pleasant staff. I am very certain that our waitress knew we weren't there to eat a full meal, and she was very respectable and left us alone. She didn't hound us or ask us a million times if we needed anything else. Just came by to refill the water, etc. We did order a small cheese plate, which was $7. Not really sure it was worth the price in retrospect, but after sitting a while, we were a bit hungry and didn't want to go crazy. I am almost certain they have a sharing fee, too.**Edit: After reading the response from Constantine, the Owner, they DO NOT have a sharing fee. :) Thanks, Constantine, for the clarification! The coffee we drank was nice, and there is a full bar off the end of the diner itself. I would absolutely go back with more money, more time, and with my husband.

32800,11544,4742,4.0,1,2015-01-02,"I must clarify that this restaurant deserves 5 stars simply for their food.  The reason I gave it a 4 stars is because there's room for improvement besides the food they serve.  This restaurant is fairly small which is pretty normal for some restaurants in Philadelphia; however, this was really the smallest restaurant I've ever been to.  Once you walk in, you will see a curtain forming a square that looks something like a Photo booth.  We made reservations for 8:15pm on new years eve, but did not get seated until 8:45pm.  The wait really wasn't that much of a problem, the problem was the host/waitress was not at all attentive to let us know when our table would be ready.  The curtain made it even more awkward when you have to constantly peep in to see if you can catch the waitress/hostess and find out when our table would be ready.  Half of the restaurant was basically the kitchen with a counter.  The whole restaurant can seat no more than 20 people.  The place could use some decor, it was mostly just a white wall.  It would be pleasing to the eye if some artworks were added.  The coat racks were placed in very inconvenient locations where people had to reach over other people to get their coats.   Little Fish mainly serves fish/seafood; nothing else.  It is true when one restaurant specializes in one thing only, they should be EXPERTS at it and Little Fish really does perform when it comes to serving FISH.  We pretty much ordered most of the things available on the menu and everything was REALLY FANTASTIC!  The menu is handwritten, which I found very unique.  I started the meal with oysters (east coast and west coast).  These really were FRESH oysters, best I've ever tasted.  Every fish dish we ordered were FRESH, tasty, and flavorful.  The price of oysters and fish entrees were very pricey; however, you do pay for what you get.  I personally think it is worth the price.  They only had one dessert, chocolate cake hazelnut ice cream praline, the cake was rather dry; however the ice cream was delicious.  It's a good thing this place is BYOB; otherwise, a meal here would be very expensive. Overall, I was happy to try this place and would definitely come back for their food.  I would probably rather come back during the summer because it wasn't pleasant to wait in that curtain Photo Booth.

I have eaten in so many Mexican restaurants and this is something in between a taco truck in Newark and chipotle.  I compare it to chipotle because you can customize your tacos, burritos, and enchiladas. You can go as authentic as you like meaning you can garnish with lime, cilantro, radish, raw onions and amazing salsas or you can have grated cheese if that's your thing. But either way, it tastes great. So now let's talk tacos. They are off the charts. The lengua tacos and pork and pineapple tacos are off the charts.  The price is too good to be true because for 6.50 you get 3 huge tacos and sides of rice and beans. The seasoning on the taco and enchilada meat is perfect and you can spice it up or down as much as you want. The biggest difference between this place and every other Mexican place I have been to, the owner is super friendly and goes out of his way to please his customers.  I will be a regular here because the food is legit and now I don't have to go into a city for great Mexican food.

But at these prices, I could go to elsewhere and get much more for the same. Maybe you wouldn't get pheasant or the service wouldn't be as good but... But. It's a tough call.

As always, the menu is pretty impressive, with many options to accommodate various diets. The specials that day were especially enticing. It was hard to choose, but I ended up going with their ""Lambwich"" which was tender and flavorful braised lamb shoulder inside toasted ciabatta bread, topped with arugula, shredded carrots, raisin jam, and harissa aioli sauce. It came with a side salad that could feed an entire adult, which made me really happy about the healthy vs. unhealthy ratio of this meal.

It's pretty cheap and the tacos are BIG - it's a great value.  I can't wait to come back to try the burritos and chips.  So happy with this place.  Highly reccomended.

TACOS are massive in quantity (more so than other taco places nearby) and quite flavorful for a very reasonable price. Get the AL PASTOR (pork) taco and the chicken taco. ADD the guac. You know you were thinking about it. BURRITOS - not as large but still quite good. I would get the tacos over burritos though.

They never make eye contact and heavens forbid you want service. You get the impression you are imposing on them. Sad reality is this is a management problem. They should not stand for it.

I wish I remembered his name. He was so courteous, and knowledgeable about everything on the menu. When I didn't like my drink he brought me another one, no questions asked. He also allowed us to order a side (the caramelized Brussels sprouts) as an appetizer. The kicker was that he brought us some champagne so that we could toast my birthday. I would highly recommend the Brussels sprouts & Roma tomato flatbread. I wasn't crazy about my entree (turkey skewer with pita and Greek salad) because I felt it needed more bread and more sauce. My husband loved his pork loin though. The desserts were amazing - the presentation is very unique (little shot glasses with edible decorations) and it was hard to choose just one.

The decor definitely screamed the need for attention, but was clean enough.   Although I honestly thought, initially by looking at the menu - I thought I would have been able to get the same dishes from my local neighborhood take out. I was glad I gave this place a chance. The predominantly Asian crowd attested to the really good high quality meals. I got the Seafood Panfried Noodles - which had tons of scallons, jumbo shrimp, calamari on top of the noodles. Also got the beef with bamboo shoots and the shitake mushrooms. Both dishes were superb. I'd definitely come back to this place.

Hostess & server could not have been more pleasant and welcoming, which was surprising considering such a stressful holiday dinner service. Appys of arugula salad and fried calamari were shared and enjoyed by all. Entrees of pan seared sea scallops, lobster risotto, hanger steak (medium well), and filet mignon (ordered butterflied & well-done) were all appropriately prepared, and served properly (read that: no ""who gets"" from the runner!) Bottle of wine, coffee & a shared dessert came to $60/person, incl. gratuity. Nice, cozy atmosphere. Fairly easy to locate and situated in a very trendy area. Clean, though small restrooms (you know what they say, ""If they can't keep the bathrooms clean, imaging what the kitchen looks like."") Festively, jam-packed, ballooned ceiling decorated for New Year's Eve. Cons: We were not told when we made reservations, or prior to being seated, that we would need to be finished and out by 9pm for the beginning of their final NYE seating. By 9:30pm our waiter very apologetically mentioned that they really need to turn over the table. Not a big star-deduction as we were already finished with coffee & dessert and headed out. Yes, would have been nice to be made aware ahead of time, but perfectly understandable for a 2nd service on a busy New Year's Eve. Overall, a very pleasant experience. Only caution is the prices. Ordering off the regular menu (not prix fixe) can be $$+, but check the menu before visiting, and be prepared. Value for price is average......not great, but not disappointing either. Would consider returning or recommending to others.

Sure it's nice inside and has an intimate, yet energized, atmosphere, but there's definitely no ""WOW"" factor. Let me put it to you this way....I don't leave excited to come back. These types of bars are a dime a dozen in NYC. Just off the corner of 30th avenue on 34th street, Sweet Afton offers plenty of beers on tap, decent house cocktails, and candle lit tables. Most drinks though are a bit overpriced in my mind. The place is also quite small/narrow and gets packed very easily. There's a nice tiny garden in the back of the bar though, with a few tables for during the warmer days of the year. The food here is probably the highlight of any visit. Assuming you can even get a table, since few surprisingly exist, definitely try their mac & cheese, burgers, grilled cheese, and beer battered fried pickles! Really really good! Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place as a quiet date spot. It definitely gets loud and packed with people which might make it hard to get to know your date.

I grew up in astoria Queens and have been here for over 30 years. I visit bars in astoria frequently and never once have I experienced a bartender to treat me the way I was treated at this venue more recently. To the owner(s) of ""Sweet Afton"" Customer service is a priority with any business especially in the food and beverage industry, don't let your now popular reputation get the best of your business. Your bartender and management need a serious staff training session. As well as an additional bartender on staff.

Some cheap stuff from California.  Do yourselves a favor, folks.  There are better Italian restaurants in Little Italy.

It is fast to get the bagels they provide quick service that is not the problem. The cashier who takes your order for some reason always has an attitude no matter who is at the register. Maybe the third visit is the charm and they will be decent. But I won't let someone's attitude effect this review. The egg and cheese on a croissant is super good. Oh my gosh the amount of cheese is mouth watering. It looks like a gooey melted mountain. Boy it was super super good!! A bit pricey to be coming here often.

The 1000+ reviews speak for themselves, but it's truly an awesome place to grab brunch on a date or with friends. The menu is filled with familiar breakfast and lunch staples, but they manage to find ways to spice up the classics you know and love. We ordered breakfast sandwiches, huevos rancheros, and the chicken lunch special - and each was mouthwatering. At first glance a breakfast sandwich shouldn't be anything special, but this one was. The brioche bun, flavorful sausage patty and perfectly fried egg with gooey yolk added up to a sandwich I didn't want to put down.  The next time I come I have to try  the pancakes or French toast, each time I saw one pass by I had a little bit of buyer's remorse over not ordering them. Service here is another high note on the overall experience. My coffee cup was never left more than half empty (which may not have been great for limiting caffeine intake but I'm not complaining), and our waiter was attentive and helpful. He even went out of his way to check with the kitchen on allergies to ensure we ordered the right items. We didn't venture into the cocktail territory but on a quick look through of the menu, they look like something special and provide good reason to come back.

45144,41127,395,3.0,1,2015-01-04,"I was meeting a couple of friends for brunch on Saturday at the Cookshop. While we had a reservation (from OpenTable) my friend accidentally made it for the day before so we had to wait. It was a Saturday afternoon (around 2:00 PM) so I assumed there'd be some waiting. Despite the rain/snow/slush coming down outside, the place was pretty packed. After waiting for about 20-30 minutes (not bad, but my friend had been waiting 30 minutes before I arrived) our table for 3 was ready. Following the hostess through the crowded dining hall, we arrived at our table in the back near the bathrooms. The hostess thanked us for our patience (much appreciated gesture) and we sat down. Our server (Sydney?) came by shortly after and offered us tea or coffee (not complimentary, by the way). We then ordered our drinks. I tried the BLT Bloody Mary ($13) which included an actual piece of bacon. It was tasty. Not the best Bloody Mary I've ever tasted but not bad. The ""B"" (bacon) was a little gross (fatty and soggy...yet not limp...odd consistency) and the ""L"" (lettuce) component was literally just a piece of sad looking lettuce. The presentation wasn't that impressive in person (though it didn't look bad with an Instagram filter). We ordered some Beignets ($11) and some kind of coffee cake for the table. Both were tasty but not out of this world. For food I ordered the gingerbread pancakes ($14) and a side of turkey sausage links (with mezcal  and cheddar cheese) ($8). As soon as my pancakes arrived in was overwhelmed (in a good way) by the smell of gingerbread. Delicious! Topped with a dollop of honey-cinnamon butter, caramelized apples, candied pecans and a side of maple syrup, the pancakes were fluffy and delicious. The gingerbread flavor wasn't intense or overpowering but just right. The sausage however was a bit of a disappointment. $8 for 2 bland sausage links...not worth it in my opinion. They were smokey which added a nice flavor but otherwise disappointing. After we finished our cocktails we ordered a glass of wine and finished our meal. Overall, the food at Cookshop was good. I had never heard of this place so i came in with absolutely no expectations whatsoever. When I got in the door and saw how crowded it was was, plus the prices on the menu my expectations, of course, changed. If I'm paying more for my food and drink I expect everything to be outstanding. With the exception of the pancakes, mine just wasn't. New York City has so many places that are, not only less expensive but also have unlimited drink options. I do hear that the brunch menu changes with some frequency so I'd be interested in coming back when things change over again. Until then, I'll be salivating over the thought of those delicious gingerbread pancakes.

We were five for a Sunday night dinner and there were no serious complaints around the table. It was also a bit of a reunion / get together so company can have some influence on reviews. I opened with the mushroom broth soup which was amazing. I think the best dish at the table. I went with the Mezze for a main, which is a bit off base for their menu, but it's the veg option. It was okay. We had two pork mains and the tuna. The pork got solid reviews, the tuna was a bit over done. I can't remember the last main - not a great thing - but there were no complaints. Desserts were split - not stunning, but good. Five with a few drinks came to about $235, without tip. Probably more than the quality called for, but it's Manhattan. I'd go again, I'd recommend it.

47690,21862,420,4.0,1,2015-01-01,"I realize that Bruno's is a full service Italian-American joint that cooks a fairly large menu, but let's face it! The star attraction here is the Sicilian pizza. Tomato laden, with a soft fluffy crust and crunchy bottom, and just enough cheese beneath the sauce to give you some chewy resistance, it provides a singular eating experience that you will not want to end.  I live about 40 miles away from Bruno's, but I still get uncontrollable cravings for their square. On technical points, perhaps It is only exceeded, by Al Santillo's square, in the state of NJ. In my opinion, debating this point is futile. It's simply better to visit both places and surrender yourself to the experience. You will not be disappointed on either account, although in Al's case your wallet will be a heck of a lot lighter. Bruno's offers far better value for the dollar, but in Al's defense he offers better quality on the toppings front, which is what really runs up the bill at Santillo's. As for negatives, the rest of the menu is a crapshoot. They also offer round pies, and the best that can be said about them is that it will not offend. They do not have a good sauce to cheese ratio, and in contrast to the square, they top the pies with too much cheese, which totally mutes the flavor of the tomato. The crust is also unremarkable. In regard to management, either Rich or Mike are always there manning the ovens, which leads to a mixed bag experience for the customer. The positive is that the consistency of the Square has remained unchanged for 30 plus years, as a result of having hands on owners. The drawback is that the long hours, and wear and tear of the restaurant business has made them both cranky and taciturn. Don't expect to be greeted by ""Mr Cuddlesworth""once darkening the doors. On a good day you can engage both in some conversation, especially when they have the ball game on, but on others it's better to remember the old adage""Silence is Golden and stay clear. Personally, I do not deduct points for this type of behavior in regard to my ratings. As a matter of fact, it can often imbue a distinct character to a place that often makes for good theater. Some crankiness suits Bruno's, and a more Saccherine experience would be out of place here. However, I realize that some in this forum place a greater credence on service than I do, so they should be warned before making their virgin pilgrimage. Also, it can be either comforting or disconcerting to know that the appearance of Bruno's remains unchanged over the 25 years that I have been visiting. This ain't the Ritz, so prepare yourself a slightly grimy strip mall joint, who's design motif can best be described as early crapola.

The pollo ""Chicharron"" was fantastic with the sweet plaintains, rice and beans. My wife had the sirloin steak which was cooked to perfection! My daughter had the "" Mambo"" eggplant platter which she enjoyed very much. Service is great, our server Pedro was very polite and took his time to explain the menu thoroughly, being that it was our first time there. The decor is cool, comfortable and the music was great. Would definitely recommend the Mambo tea house to all my friends.

Usually when I come here I get the two-ways duck, which is my favorite thing on the menu and an appetizer of edamame and pot stickers. Both really delicious. This time around I went with the family before Christmas, and we decided to do the hibachi, and it was very entertaining. Everyone loved it and loved their meals as well. I ended up ordering the soft shell crab and a spicy tuna roll for an appetizer. I hadn't had the crab before, and it was crazy good, and I also really love their sushi. They stuff a lot of meat in there, so you actually can get a good taste of it. For the main course, I went with the sirloin. The hibachi cook was very funny and talented, and I give him props for making everyone at the table crack up. He also cooked my steak and vegetables perfectly. For the show and amount of food, the hibachi is a pretty good deal. I usually come here whenever I'm in town and never disappointed, so you can bet I'll be back on my next trip.

We wanted to try a bit of everything Bartaco offered since we had both been meaning to try it for quite some time. We ordered the chipotle slaw and grilled corn as sides. I order 2 falafel tacos and one portobello taco. My boyfriend ordered a spicy chorizo, baja, and chicken taco. For dessert, we had churros. This all sounds like a lot of food, but Bartaco has small servings and will likely leave you hungry if you only order 3 tacos. A waiter put the wrong food (a spicy cucumber salad) on our table and when we alerted him of his mistake, he said we could keep the salad free of charge for his mistake. Now onto the meals, my tacos were delicious. They were tiny and left me wanting to order 3 more. The falafel taco looks a bit unappealing and not too crispy. The flavor was almost perfect though and was my favorite of the two tacos I tried. (Not as good as Mamoun's but that's an unfair comparison) The two sides we tried were very good. The slaw wasn't very spicy and not very exciting, but I'd order it again. The grilled corn was the outstanding choice for sides, though. I didn't think corn could be so delicious. The most disappointing part of the meal was a the churros. I read good things about them on here, but ours weren't worth the price.

I am itching to give it 5 stars just because I enjoyed this hole in the wall, exotic experience so much but there were a few things could have been better. Upon entering, we were immediately seated despite not having a reservation. My favorite part was the complete lack of menu - the waiter just arrived and told us that we would be enjoying a 7 course meal that was pre-set and simply gave us the choice of lamb or chicken for our main course. I am not a picky eater so I really liked not having to choose and having the opportunity to enjoy what the restaurant thought were their best dishes and this enhanced my experience. The first dish was my favorite, composed of three different salads and was my favorite part of the meal. The carrots and eggplant were perfectly spiced and I could have eaten the portion meant for 3 people entirely by myself. One of the courses I did not enjoy, though others may, was a chicken souffle type thing. The waiter told us it was chicken but my friends and I could find only egg inside, no chicken. In addition to this, it was sprinkled with powdered sugar which, to me, kind of ruined it as I do not like my savory mixed with my sweet - especially eggs and sugar. I gave it a try but it was kind of gross. The lamb was perfect and fell off the bone, and the spicy sauce that we had served on the side is what made the dish perfect. Another thing that I did not like was concerning the fruit plate at the end. The oranges were hard to peel, the grapes had seeds, and overall it was inaccessible and difficult, especially in the dim lighting. I would suggest to the restaurant that they cut the fruits or get smaller, seedless ones for the enjoyment of the customers. After eating 5 courses (it was the 6th), I do not want to sit there spitting out seeds or trying to peel things with great difficult (...slightly exaggerated but there was so much luxury in the rest of the meal it should be followed through to the end). I especially enjoyed the ending note - baklava and moroccan mint tea which was delicious and perfectly balanced. All in all this is a place where I would bring friends, family, etc for the ethnic and cultural experience unlike anything I have enjoyed before and the food was overall enjoyable as well. I will most definitely be back!

I was highly skeptical after reading many of the reviews given the price points here but I had a very satisfying first experience and can now recommend it (for brunch at least). It was snow-slushing outside so we had no wait for a table, a rarity at popular spots in BK. If you are looking for traditional, you might be disappointed (i.e. no pancakes or French toast on this menu), but if you want something slightly out of the ordinary Do Or Dine has you covered. Try the shishito pepper app,which comes with five dipping salts. I think the deep fried deviled eggs ""E666S"" were a miss - kinda dry. As for entrees, the Fried Brussel Benny was delish and unique in flavors with one of the best hollandaise I've ever had. The lamb hash was a straight forward creation but still tasty. You can get a mimosa/bloody for $6 with an entree. They take cards and payment through an app. The servers were friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu. The background jams were cool. My biggest complaint would be the disco ball lights...unnecessary and annoying...it's a restaurant, not a dance hall.

For a fun night out, go to Do or Dine. They also have great cocktails! I especially loved the disco ball!

FOOD - about 133% overpriced. at this price point there are better options. mexican margherita pizza - concept is intriguing (salsa, bacon, jalapeno), execution less so -- not fresh mozarella, salsa was blah (drowned out the other tastes), etc. meatloaf - supposedly a signature dish. this one was pretty good, but the fries it came with were supposed to be truffle fries, although there was no taste of truffle anywhere. fried chicken & waffles - warned ahead of time that it would take ~30 minutes; not worth the wait. waffles were soggy. anyway, will not be coming here again.

52608,46087,472,2.0,1,2015-01-05,"Given how crowded Cafe Henri was for Sunday brunch, my friends and I decided to check out Open Door across the street. The first thing I noticed upon entering was how empty it was on a Sunday afternoon. Nonetheless we were initially satisfied with finding a place for us to sit down, eat, and catch up. I ordered the set of three sliders - duck, beef, and pork - and a side of fries. To be honest, the sliders were quite bland that even the mayonnaise and sauces could not redeem the flavor. The sliders were presented with their buns to the side such that I could not tell which bun was assigned to which burger. Each bun had a different condiment and I forgot the menu description, so it wasn't an easy match-making process. The fries were too soft that it seemed as if they were microwaved from frozen. My friend ordered slices of lox which were salty. The general consensus among my friends was that the food was mediocre. I would not go here if your primary goal is to get a well made and tasty brunch. However, if you do want bottomless brunch for $20 (which at that point food quality is not a major concern), this is the place to go. Perhaps this is more of a happy hour joint? I'm sure it's better for drinks.

""Mix and match"" was the theme of the brunch menu - they had multiple varieties of eggs benedict and sliders which you could customize for your order. Heck, they even had a brunch tasting! This concept was exciting until the food turned out to be sub-par. This was a classic case of jack of all trades, master of none. I had the eggs benedict with pulled pork and smoked salmon. The pulled pork was salty, but decent. The smoked salmon, however, was inedible - it was overwhelmingly salty and even putrid! The eggs were also poached to the point where the yolk was not even runny. The only redeeming aspect was the fruit salad it came with. The fruit was fresh and the coconut cream they put on top was tasty. We also tried a couple other items: the only thing that was good for the brunch tasting was the french toast. The sliders sounded good on paper but the patties were rubbery. This seems like a better place at night, but look elsewhere to nurse your Saturday hangover.

Need to mention I ordered a side of mexican rice too ... it was very well made, that it sort of melted in my mouth, was very smooth.  Added some house made salsa to it, which mixed very well with it. The owners were also very sweet and accommodating, enjoyed the service for a take out spot. Chipotle and Qdoba, watch out!

The shrimp and fish and grits were amazing. The grits were creamy  and fluffy with nice subtle flavors and the mixture of both the shrimp and fried fish in the dish came together nicely.

As for the cocktails, the margarita was all sour mix.. and I believe we tried another staple that came out pretty bad.

The place was also a bit weird as there was no bar which raises the question of who is making the cocktails... perhaps someone who shouldn't be bartending.

60200,51196,525,4.0,1,2015-01-01,"We've been here a few times over the years during our trips to Vermont and remember it to be a nice spot. We stopped in on New Years Eve for a nice, simple dinner and were not disappointed. The wait was an excusable 15 minutes, so we grabbed seats at the bar. The beer selection is what you'd expect for a decent-sized place: plenty of local brews, a few seasonals and the typical bar brands. The prices at the bar were a bit high, though I suspect that may be a touch of holiday pricing at work. Once seated we settled into a nice meal. Our waitress was prompt and courteous and welcoming to our son's request for changes to the nacho appetizer. I ordered the chicken fingers made with corn flakes and almonds and the three of us shared the two apps. The nachos were huge - a solid shareable snack. The use of Cabot Colby Jack cheese is a nice touch, but the salsa, while hot, was unremarkable. The chicken fingers were massive, but perfectly cooked. The mustard sauce was just tangy enough to complement the breaking on the chicken. Our son ordered a wrap for his dinner. It was nicely put together but lacked anything worth noting. It was good - not bad, not great, just food. The fries are what you'd expect to get at most restaurants now: larger cuts with that flaky coating common of restaurants. My wife had the lobster risotto, a special for the night. It was generous portion of perfectly cooked risotto with a light sauce. The lobster meat was served on a half-tail to be added to the bowl. It was plump and juicy, as you'd expect of lobster. The toasted bread served with the meal seemed a superfluous afterthought, though if you're given to wiping your bowl clean with bread, it makes sense. I had the meatloaf dinner. The menu said it was served with Yukon potatoes and seasonal vegetables - which I correctly predicted would be broccoli. The potatoes were a decent mashed potatoes with simple seasoning and just enough flavor. The broccoli was a touch under steamed. I ended up cutting up the broccoli and mixing it into the potatoes to create a better flavor all around. The meatloaf was perfect, however, with just enough crust on each slice to make every bite feel familiar and comforting. I generally don't like gravy on anything but this was an exception worth making. As for atmosphere, this is a friendly place right on Church Street that allows for people watching or a brief respite from the active hustle outside. We'll certainly be back.

When we arrived, we found a long line and decided it was best to look for another place. We yelped it and found a soul food joint with 5 stars, so we said ""we gotta try this yo!"" So we moseyed along to Sandra's and found the place. With no indication of it being a restaurant with its tinted windows, I thought it looked more like a nail salon or something other than a restaurant. The area was a tad sketchy, but despite our car being full of desirables at the time we decided to go in and keep an eye out on the car. When we went in, the place was filled with mismatched tables and chairs - not the most pleasant of facilities. However, before long we were served by our pleasant and polite waiter some sweeeet tea and cornbread and we forgot about our car and odd surroundings. The lunch special entrees came out - fried chicken (wings) with fried okra and corn, pork chopped bbq with string beans and potato salad - and I was like ""man, we wish we had a place like this in NYC or Boston to eat at!"" While I'm sure if you lived in Alabama or Mississippi you'd get soul food as good as this, but when compared to Harlem (where I go to school), this place is about as good as it gets in the Northeast. Every single food product, including the sides, were just full of delightful flavors. The potato salad was impeccable. The pork chopped bbq was perhaps my favorite - sooo juicy, man. The fried chicken is probably better than Sylvia's, the 'Queen of Soul Food,' in Harlem. Even better was that this is a family joint run by a crew of Sandra's kids. They were so polite and nice, giving us a splash of Southern hospitality we rarely find in the Northeast. They even gave us a try of the oxtail with Caribbean rice, which was super awesome. We will surely come back more often when we make the drive between our home (Boston) and pseudo-home (NYC). Keep up the good work, Sandra's!

The fingerling ""fries"" are downright additcting-it's a mason jar filled with fried smashed fingerling potatoes served in this ridiculous cheese sauce.

This location is the newest Tria in the city and it has a modern and hip feel to it along with the amazing everyday food menu they offer in all their restaurants. Who doesn't want to sip wine while looking at exposed bricks! The menu is the same as the other Trias with the exception of 1. All beers are drafts, they do not have bottled beers here and 2. they have the drink menu in ipads and you can get very detailed information an all the drinks as well as what percentage of your drink is left in the restaurant. So if your favorite drink has a low barrel percentage, you better order up. Pretty decent feature if you ask me! The very detailed list of ingredients in all the drinks make you want to order new and exciting things you haven't drank before. Well done Tria, well done!

In fact we left early on one visit because the noise level was so aversive that our ears were ringing and it was impossible to carry on a conversation. The food continues to be predictable and OK but so overpriced for essentially diner food. The service is chaotic and staff is not trained competently. Recently our party of 8 tried to get in on a weekday at 5 pm and the host was so scattered that he barely knew what he was doing with a line that was out the door. He looked like a deer in the headlights. Not confidence inspiring. And the people kept waiting while he dithered. Then come to find out that they NOW have changed to taking reservations. Way to go Jones -- should have done that years ago not changed the rules midstream. Needless to say, we did not have reservations and they missed out on feeding 8 hungry people. This place is on its demise I think and I further think that Starr needs to attend to the complaints that people who know food and service and ambiance are posting here and on other venues. I don't see that happening.

Friend had london broil with twice baked potato and garlic drenched spinach.  The plate looked like it had just stepped out of the 70s- as designed.  Spinach was a bit over whelming w/ all the garlic but everything else was very good.

I ordered the nasi gorang (not on the menu, but you can ask for it) and it was delicious. It was like eating it in Sri Lanka. My wife ordered a fish kotthu. Even though I'm not a big fan of fish in my kotthu, I had some of it and it was the best quality kotthu roti I have eaten in a long time. I recommend getting a meat kotthu rotti, just because fish is easily chopped up and you can barely see it. I got a deviled chicken as well which was very well prepared. Price is very reasonable too. The only downside is the food takes a long time to prepare (which is a good thing because you know the food is freshly made), so I suggest calling ahead (atleast 45 mins prior to arrival during prime lunch or dinner times). I am looking forward to going again soon. To the owner- please don't let your quality go down. Lot of other Sri Lankan restaurants in that area were extremely good when they first opened, but after some time the quality of the food and cleanliness of the restaurant kept degrading. I would also like to see a unlimited Kotthu night at least once a month (I did not know about the one you had before). Good luck to you!

66249,23104,1763,5.0,1,2015-01-07,"This place is a 5 for me, mostly because I absolutely love showing this place off to friends and visitors who brave the trip to Brooklyn from whatever borough they're in. Things to know: 1. They have an electronic wait list Go in and tell the host your name/#, and feel free to roam around. They don't always have this system in place, but they are normally pretty lenient about it - they're not like other places where you MUST be there when they call your name or you go to the back of the line. 2. The kale salad is amazing. It is one of my favorite things to eat, ever. It's delicious, and even if you don't like kale or salad, you will like this. It has pieces of tempura'd kale, along with crunchy sweet potato, golden raisins, and just an addictive dressing. 3. Different ramens have different noodles. I'm not a ramen pro, so I'm not sure what these noodles are actually called, but I know the pork bone ramen has a thinner, harder noodle than the miso ramen, which has a slightly thicker, softer noodle. 4. Go within 1/2 an hour of opening to avoid a wait. I am so, so, so lucky to live so close by, that on weekends I can wake up and walk to Chuko with no fear of a wait. Otherwise, I think the wait is around 15 minutes to an hour, depending on when you go. 5. Don't go with a gigantic group It's a pretty intimate area - it's not the most comfortable place to eat, unless you're lucky and get one of the side booths. 6. Cash only But don't fret, they have an ATM in store. One down side - sometimes the ATM can only spit out 50's, so just be aware of that. 7. Extra noodles are $1 extra. So, double the size of your meal for an amazing price! Although, I rarely ever finish the first bowl of noodles.. 8. Everything is delicious. I have been trying to eat my way round the menu, and so far, there isn't a single thing I haven't liked. My favorites are the miso ramen (I think it has more depth of flavor than the pork bone, and you won't even want to add the spicy garlic oil that they offer) and kale salad (must be said again).

Being vegetarian I ALWAYS go for the veggie ramen and it never ever disappoints.  Rich, flavorful broth with seasonal veggies usually topped with fresh arugula.  So damn delicious.  Good for meat eaters and veggies/vegans alike! Had some tasty drinks, beer and sake here too. Cons: long wait time (but you can now wait down the block at Bar Chuko), cash only, always packed Tips: show up just before opening for dinner. Or put your name in and head over to Bar Chuko or Weathered Up and get a tasty cocktail.  They have a super helpful free app you can download that will inform you of the tables ahead of you.

66254,19677,1763,4.0,1,2015-01-03,"Just a nice side story to set up the scene. I put my name down for a table-- about an hour wait. So I went to run some errands. When they texted that my table was ready, I quickly hopped in the car and drove there. Of course, the traffic gods decide to pull one on me when I was about 10 blocks away from the place. So I decided to ditch the driver and just run in the cold for 10 blocks just so I don't lose my seats from Chuko. From this review, I obviously made it in time but for about 20-30 minutes, I couldn't breathe. Okay, time to see if this place was worth the run. Food: Had to order the pork buns, kale salad, brussel sprouts and a bunch of different ramen. The pork buns were decent-- nothing memorable at all. Ippudo still has the best pork buns. Kale salad and brussel sprouts were okay. I wished the kale salad was mixed a bit because some kale had too much dressing and some had none. I do like the crunch though and who doesn't like kale. The brussel sprouts were spicy and roasted which I do enjoy. I would probably pick the kale salad over the brussels. Time for the ramen piece. Get the veggie ramen. The best of out the ones I tried. Loved the texture of the noodles. The broth flavors were balanced and with their garlic chili oil, oh boy. The pork bone ramen does not use traditional ramen noodles, which is a bummer! It's more of vermicelli noodle type. Didn't really enjoy that broth either. The soy ramen was my second favorite-- nice and subtle flavor. Lastly, the miso ramen was not memorable. Sorry. Ambiance: Place is small but by no means too cramped. Not too loud either. Restroom was clean-- no complaints. Service: First time I came the service sucks. I wanted to wait in the restaurant and they gave me an attitude and was like ""Hey, you're not going to wait in here, right?"" Well, all is forgiven after my second attempt of trying to test this place out. The waitress was really nice. Water was replenished whenever it was empty. She even let one of my friends charge their phone. The Bottom Line: I'll be backkkk-- even though the wait is brutal. I asked if I could add 2 more people to my party 20 mins after I put my name down, and they told me it was an extra 2-3 hour wait. Sorry, must ditch the 2 people then. Place was pretty good overall. Can't find another good ramen place in brooklyn.

Burger we have ordered came with a charred patty. I'm not sure I would expected well done to be so charred. Onion soup itself delicious, however cheese/bread cap too tough to chew. Chechen liver pate was far too frozen when served. It was quite hard to spread. Raw oysters were fresh and delicious. Oyster sauces/toppings went very well with them. Bronzino was well grilled and very fresh. I'm satisfied with it. Service a bit neurotic from both the waiter and the manager. It seems later night shift staff is far more chill than evening. It took a while to get the check. I'm not sure I'm coming back to Blue Ribbon anymore. Things I like aren't on the menu anymore. You just can't take Uni sushi off the menu and expect me to be happy, but they did.

(and probably chick peas too but I can tolerate them on pretty much anything) Basically all I could taste was a ton of mustard, red cabbage, carrots sprouts and bell peppers and that did not a great sandwich make.  I guess I put a little too much faith in whoever crafted the menu I just don't know how anyone could have tried that burger and said ""We've got a real winner here lets include it as a menu item!!!"" Sarcasm aside I will order from them again for the chili but I'll be staying far far away from that turkey burger. The End :)

I will make two notes to play Devil's Advocate on this experience: 1) We went on a Sunday 2) We went on the Sunday after New Years, when most people were still out of town. Given these two points, I am willing to give this place a second chance.  I just hope that I am completely wow-ed by the experience next time...otherwise I am going to have to question every single 5-star review on this page and wonder how these people got such amazing food and I did not...

69127,56407,608,4.0,1,2015-01-02,"I came here really for one dish - the brisket tots. This seems to be their signature dish, and it was listed in The Infatuation's ""New York's Best New Dishes of 2014."" The tots were nice and crispy, but the brisket wasn't nearly as flavorful as something you'd get at Fette Sau or Mighty Quinn's, though it still tasted ok. The creme fraiche accompaniment was foamy and airy. I did have other dishes too, though these were hit or miss. The octopus was kind of thin - a sufficient but by no means ample portion. It was crispy, blackened on outside. The problem was that it was blander than that served at Upland. It didn't seem seasoned at all. It was cooked slightly overdone, and was not the juicy, succulent piece of seafood that I was expecting. The chickpeas that went with the dish didn't help either, because those are a bland accompaniment also. The server apologized and asked if there was anything they could do. I said don't worry about it, no problem. It's not their fault. Not all dishes can be winners. Now the tubeti dish, on the other hand, was great. It's easy to get excited upon just seeing this thing. It's very playful, incorporating egg yolk as part of the sauce. There was enough duck confit and there were crispy things for texture. It had a slight tangy flavor. The pasta was cooked nicely - not too soft. They sent out tomato braised kale to make up for the octopus. It was very good. A healthy but not overpowering amount of spiciness. But unfortunately my last dish of the night was the short rib, which was also bland. In addition, it was wet and crumbly. I realize that strip steak is not as flavorful as the ribeye that I'm normally used to eating, but it still could have been better. It was cooked perfectly though. I ended the evening with some Ribe Mjod mead. I had never had mead before. It's a honey wine. Sweet, but not cloyingly so. Still, whether it was the sugar content or the viscosity, I couldn't finish a whole glass. So, in all, I'm still giving four stars despite a couple of misses because the service is good and the restaurant is trying to do some creative things.

Other than that I wasn't as lucky with the other choices.  The meat was dry and although well seasoned it felt like it was sitting there for a while.  Total billed for 2 people was $45, we had a Groupon which helped but if I was to pay full price for our dinner I would have been disappointed.  Can I eat a good meal for that amount somewhere else,  I know I can.  I really wanted to love this place.

Good luck finding seats--you will probably want to take your hoagie to go, but it makes perfect picnic food, so you will enjoy it nonetheless. 2. A whole sandwich=an entire baguette overflowing with goodness.  Unless you're starving, you may want a 1/2.  Tonight I barely made a dent in my 1/2 tuna hoagie and was comfortably full.  The portions are huge.   3. Realize that this silly, little take-out hoagie place is unforgettable and that you will be rhapsodizing about it even years later.

73585,13798,660,3.0,1,2015-01-04,"Came here for a going away party for a client, so I can't really comment on the perceived value, since I didn't pay. A look at the online menu shows some reasonably high prices, but you don't expect anything less with black-and-white tiled floors, moody, faux-antique lighting and a location that straddles midtown and the Upper East Side. If a bacon cheeseburger wasn't nearly $25 that actually be some cause for alarm. This isn't a huge place, which means the even when full of white collar professionals trying to get to three drinks before the 7:20 to Brewster, you can still carry a conversation. We didn't even have the back room, which while part of the space seems easier to cordon off. That said, our hosts made sure that the cocktails, wine, beer and surprisingly top-shelf whiskey included in the open bar with constantly refilled. Also impressive were the sheer amount of food brought to feed our party of 25 or so. These weren't sliders, they were whole burgers cut into quarters. Veggie plates overflowed, along with the harder to eat meatballs and pieces of calamari. Was I in a state to make a considered judgement of how this place uses the fryer? Not particularly, but I know that this wasn't one of those nights where I needed to have dinner due to insultingly small canapés. I imagine later in the evening this could be an intimate place for a nightcap and some lingering conversation - once the cash-cow corporate crowd has fled back to their suburban homes.

From Upland to White street etc. Have been to Little Owl quite a few times. The food is fabulous and consistent. Now comes the real reason for the review. I was thinking about the meal and entire experience last night. 02/02/2015. Light bulb went off approx. 75 watt and no not  one of those ugly squiggly energy savers. I realized from last nights meal that there are so many great places to have a great meal in the city. So after you dine and leave you remember a few things about the meal. Apps ? desert? service ? long wait perhaps? or maybe the horrible table next to you that killed the whole vibe. But you are still wondering what is this guy trying to say about Little Owl? Okay here it is. The total experience here is incredible!!! The staff mesh with each other like similar to the finest quartet at The Bushwick Starr. So well orchestrated that you become engrossed by the movement of food coming and going though the ultra small kitchen into the uber small restaurant.. There is a uncanny sense of caring about your meal and satisfaction with your overall experience as a short term guest in there establishment. I realized last night that it is so true size really doesn't matter if the execution is strong and memorable! The food is thoughtful and well presented. Light and flavorful but memorable The vibe is positive and pleasant but not overly west village granola . The service is pleasant and positive but not rushed or artificial. Sincere being the operative thought! So to sum it up there are many choices and lifetime of experiences some memorable to our palate's some to our hearts some to the left side of our brain and some to the right side . This place hit a trifecta  for me. Worth the wait if there is one and well worth the drive if you don't live in the city,

For mains, we shared both the chicken and the lamb shank. The chicken was the best I have ever had, super juicy and flavorful with a crisp skin. The lamb was good as well, but I much preferred the chicken. Finally, we split a chocolate cake type dessert. I cant remember exactly what it was called, but it was superb. I am a sucker for chocolate. The space they have is nice and cozy, and the service is excellent. We arrived around 6pm on a Friday and were put in the queue. We went around the corner for drinks and got a call about an hour later for our table. Definitely one of the better meals I have had in NY. Would highly recommend The Little Owl to anyone!

I called to verify that they use chicken breast  and not a processed patty.  They said yes and I still ventured to order.  I did that with another pizza place and they told me they served chicken but I got a patty. The delivery came fast.  We ordered a cheeseburger and chicken parm dinner. The cheeseburger was ordered well done and came overcooked. It was edible but hard.  The person who had it said that but ate the entire thing which says a lot. I had the chicken parm and it came with a single chicken piece.  It had only mozzarella on the chicken with tons of spaghetti. Although it was different from what I was expecting to be presented, it was fantastic!! The sauce was perfect in flavor, the spaghetti was perfectly cooked and delicious.  The chicken was flavorful and perfectly cooked, not overdone by any measure! It was a bit pricey but it was worth it.  I judge a pizza place by the taste of their sauce and this hit the mark, spot on! So if your looking for a place that does a decent chicken parm and sauce that is outstanding, then give this place a try! I enjoyed the spaghetti with this sauce thoroughly!

The restaurant isn't very large, with just about 12 tables, but every one was occupied within 10 minutes of our arrival. Plus, the clientele was a mixed bag of Asians, caucasians, and other groups. Binh Duong must have a good reputation. Their menu is large and even offers lunch specials (rice plates). Pho is cheap at $6.50-7.95 a bowl. We started with an order of ""summer rolls"" (goi cuon) at $3.95. These were great. They were a decent size - not large, but a good size for an appetizer. The slices of shrimp were generous and the dipping sauce was thick, dark, and flavorful. Next, my friend and I both had Pho Dac Biet ($7). The sizing here is a little strange - for example, my usual Pho Tai Nam only came in small, while Pho Dac Biet was large. I was really hungry, so I had to get something large! I was very impressed by the pho, especially being in Jersey! The garnishes even had saw leaf, though we were missing fresh jalepeno slices. The broth was tasty, the noodles were perfectly tender, and there was a lot of meat! Well, proportionally, anyway. The portion could have been bigger considering it was large, because I could have eaten more. But for the price, I can't complain too much. I would recommend Binh Duong to anyone looking for a good bowl of pho in New Jersey. The food is good, the prices are low, and the atmosphere is very pleasant.

We all know what brunch means on a Saturday and Sunday morning, LONG WAITS. This place has a dedicated room for hungry brunch goers, safe from the cold. The service is friendly and fast without rushing you out. Now onto the food. There is a variety of gluten free options. Interested in an Eggs Benedict, a dish that can almost never ever be made gluten free? Welp, they can do it here. Sure it's on bread rather than an English muffin, but the hollandaise sauce is so good that frankly, you don't give a damn. And then there's the Huevos Rancheros. My friend and I have been on an HR kick all around Philly, but Sabrina's take on the dish left us starry eyed and nostalgic for its spicy, dense flavors for days after the event (because eating Sabrina's HR is an event). The dish, featuring two blue corn tortillas with lime sour cream, spicy guacamole, two eggs and pepper jack, and topped with a fried jalapeno pepper never gets boring. You can also share one portion and still feel incredibly stuffed. And that's Sabrina's. A causal, reasonably priced brunch spot with tons of options and sensational food. It's the kind of place you can go to for two days in a row without having even a hint of ""fear-of-missing-out"" syndrome. Yum.

Sure, the dish I got instead was fine (I forget what it was). But what made it all worse was the girl at the table next to ours (and tables are a bit crammed together in here) heard the waiter apologizing profusely for running out of spaghetti and meatballs. Only she had ordered directly before me. And the waitress brought her out a heaping plate of spaghetti and meatballs which she proceeded to eat without making eye contact with me. Awkward...

Finally, we gave up and asked to pay for what we had received, and leave. They convinced us that they would box up our orders for us if we waited just a bit longer. Apparently,""just a bit longer"" means another twenty minutes. They boxed them up for us, and I arrived home to find that they had only given me half of my pizza.

First and foremost is, I am a critique of Restaurants, so lets get to business. The atmosphere is very nice, the waiter we had that evening was quite nice and did his job well. Zach. We started with the fried calamari as suggested, like some other reviews we all agreed it was bland in taste but fresh. The lances arugula salad I ordered was not fresh as well as the avocado with it.  The chicken parm was over cooked and was served with homemade pasta that must have been sitting in the drainer was clumped and stuck together, this was the same as my side order of pasta with garlic and oil. All the entrees were served warm and not hot. Portions were average. The chicken I ordered was with asparagus and crab meat. Served with 4 very skinny wilted asparagus and shaved crab meat that looked like grated cheese. Could not tell it was crab meat. The salmon dish was with spinach and roasted garlic risotto was served warm also and did not seem to blend well together. Now we ordered also the Crab and Corn Chowder and requested for it to be extra hot, it was, and the soup was very good. We ordered a Canolli for dessert and it also was very good. We ordered Espresso also but it came out not so hot and was of poor quality. Oh we asked for the Manager to let him know it was our first night and to also let him know very politely of the food critique. He didn't want to here nothing, and walked away from us. Very very poor move as a Manager. He also should have at least come to our table and ask how are you enjoying everything on your first evening here, Not to mention there was only one other table of guests in the Restaurant. There was entertainment Gary, playing guitar and singing, he did not take one break or stop singing once the entire time while we were there. I give him a 10. Now in all fairness this was the night after New Years Eve, but i'm not sure if I could give them a pass on the overall quality of the food. However I may give a try to sit back enjoy some wine and have Zach as a waiter, who actually cares at another time.

I find that there is way too much sugar added to the dishes (on top of the sweetened coconut products used in most Thai food), and I find it very off putting. As someone who has had genuine/home-cooked Thai food, I guess my standards are kind of high. The positives of Up Thai are the atmosphere and interesting drinks. While I did not order any of the cocktails, they looked promising. The interior is very pretty and welcoming. However, as soon as I tasted my Thai iced tea I grew wary. While not incredibly sweet, it was much too sugary for my liking. My boyfriend and I ordered three entrees, but, thankfully the order was messed up and we only got two entrees. One was some kind of rice in a pot (I think. It was something carb-y with a bunch of protein in a pot) and the other was a supposedly spicy curry. Both were so saccharine to the point of being inedible. The curry was not even spicy. When I asked for some kind of spice, our waiter brought out a variety of sauces and seasonings. Of course the ""chili flakes"" given to me was the MSG/salt packed chili that one is meant to use sparingly in dishes. My boyfriend and I couldn't even finish half of our food. What a waste. I suppose Up Thai is a good place to go for those who enjoy American-Thai food. I've noticed that most Americans who have never had the pleasure of trying authentic Asian cuisines enjoy their ""Asian"" food more when it is sweetened. However, it is safe to say that I will not be returning to Up Thai. It's quite overrated and overpriced for the quality of food being served. I don't like my meals being masked in pounds of sugar.

They serve free mimosas and bloody Mary's during weekend brunch and its BYOB! Order: Alway check the board for specials and the desserts! On New Year's Day, had the duck and sweet potato hash special, it was the perfect dish after a long night. Brunch items not to be missed French toast and pancakes. Lunch/dinner items, the taco apps were tasty and the short ribs entree was flavorful. The Cuban sandwich is a must get, the ham and pulled pork is a great combo. I didn't care for the chicken gyro or jerk chicken much. Both items seemed to lack flavor. Their tots are unique, imagine put potato gratin in large tot form, yum! Service: everyone is always friendly and checks on the table on a regular basis. Overall: secretly I don't want the word to get out about this place so I don't have to wait in lines.

Immediately walking in you can tell this bar/restaurant is more upscale than your usual restaurant. I was worried about how much id be spending but the prices are very reasonable. I ended up getting the AKB cheese burger as my entrée and the potato skins for the app. This burger is probably one of the best burgers I've ever tried and for a good price too. As for The potato skins, they were phenomenal as well. I've been to AKB 3 times already and fall in love with their food more and more each time. Very pleased with their new restaurant.

83236,26549,770,1.0,1,2015-01-03,"I want to start off with full disclosure: My rating is based on their business practices. I did not eat here. And I won't after speaking with one of the co-owners, Michael, about a gift certificate for $150 that I had from Culinariane. Since they had mentioned it on various writeups and their website that they were closing Culinariane and opening this new place in Verona, I assumed I'd be able to use it. When I looked (and I have a dated screenshot documenting it), nowhere on their website did it note that gift certificates must be used prior to the closing. Had that been the case, we would have made a point of making a reservation prior to their close. While I was on the phone with Michael, I read what was posted on the website to him and pointed out that lack of info, and he told me he didn't know why and how it was taken off. After I spoke with him, a notice went up on the website. A little late, no? And you have to actually go to the ""News"" link to find it, as well as to find out that they're even closed. It puzzles me why these two important tidbits of info is not in a more prominent location when you visit the Culinariane website. Shouldn't that be the first thing you see, that it's closed? There just seems to be a lack of transparency. Michael also told me that it was impossible to keep track of the gift certificates. Really, isn't that a simple accounting practice? Keep a log of when they're purchased and when they're used. Then you have an idea of how much is still outstanding. He told me that they had a meeting with the new co-owners about the unused gift certificates and they decided they would not accept them. Even though they were fully aware that they were still many unredeemed ones out there. He told me that up to the very end, before they closed, people kept insisting on purchasing gift certificates, even though he warned them they had to be redeemed prior to their closing. As if he had no control over the situation. So, why sell them at that point if you know they won't be able to redeem them? Just say no. So, he was willing to accept payment knowing that he wasn't losing anything from it. I can understand the new co-owners not feeling responsible for those gift certificates because they didn't earn any money from them. The owners of Culinariane personally drew income from the sale of the gift certificates. That income at some point went into his pocket. At the very least, why not take it out of his own pocket? As goodwill to his Culinariane patrons? Why not keep a separate account from their personal contributions to the new restaurant reserved for those unredeemed gift certificates. Or just refund them? He had options, he chose the one that benefited him. Michael didn't feel like he was responsible in any way.   After hearing so many wonderful things about their food and service, I'm more than disappointed. $150 is no chump change. I just can't support these kind of owners and their lack of respect for their customers.

83237,64514,770,5.0,1,2015-01-03,"Cannot say enough good things about this place. The food, service and atmosphere were outstanding. Ariane does a phenomenal job at combining simple ingredients together, creating new delicious flavors. A few of us sat at the bar while a few sat in the annexed quiet, intimate dining room in an adjoining space.  There is full food and drink service at both parts of the restaurant. There is also a fun snack menu only available at the bar area that we really liked - the Cuban sandwich and potato skins with goat cheese  were a great start to our meal. The group in the dining room had some appetizers off the dinner menu and loved them. The mushroom ragout over cheesy  grits are a must have off  the appetizer menu. The dinner menu had many outstanding choices. I had the chicken pot pie and loved it. You won't be disappointed by the dessert menu either, they are small so get a few to share! Last but not least, the drink selection was great here. The cocktail menu is full of drinks with unique fusions of flavor. The pomegrante moscow mule was amazing. The beer selection is also great including many local brewery choices. Since we are from Chicago we had never tried many of the beers. If you haven't had it, the Brooklyn Blast beer was great. Mike, the owner circulated around the whole restaurant during the time we were there. He was making sure everyone had a great experience, and we did! The servers and bartenders were also extremely attentive. Also, the prices are reasonable considering the quality and time put into each dish and drink.

83238,64515,770,1.0,1,2015-01-02,"As with others, the reputation of CulinAriane (which I did not have the opportunity to try) is what brought us to AKB. I call in on a Tuesday and leave a message in an attempt to make a reservation. Never received a callback. When I called again to make the reservation, the phone was answered by a female (the hostess I'm guessing). When I said I never got a call back, she asked when I left a message. I said Tuesday. Her response? ""Oh that's why. We're closed on Tuesdays."" Uhhh...seriously? With answers like that, why bother having voicemail?! Knowing what I know now I should have taken that as a hint of things to come... The first time I ate there (silly me, we ate there twice to give them the benefit of the doubt given how mediocre the first dining experience was vs. how good their Montclair reputation was and the fact that they are opened just a couple/few months), as we walked in, we overheard another customer feeding back his experience to one of the owners, Michael. While I didn't stand at the front desk the whole time, I did notice two things: a customer respectfully providing some very candid feedback and Michael being extremely defensive. Given similar experiences both times we ate there, I'm going to lump the feedback altogether as one review. The first time we arrived at what most restaurants consider second seating (7-8ish) while the second time we arrived for an earlier first seating. The staff is uniformly very polite but our experience both times was the wait staff is very green. In fact, I wonder if our first waiter worked in food service at all. Unfortunately, the impact of this goes beyond empty water glasses and being handed a bar menu instead of being handed a dessert menu. If you order fish and chips and you want condiments beyond tartar sauce, you better be bold enough to ask - in the case of one of our experiences, we didn't get asked by the server, waiter, or anyone else if we wanted cocktail sauce, malt vinegar, etc. Ironically this was one of the feedback items we overheard the first time we went. Talking about the fish and chips, we tried it during our second visit. It is a very nice portion. The fish came out kind of greasy as if the oil wasn't hot enough. That seems to be reinforced when the diner also ordered the fish and chips - an hour or two after us - and their fish came out looking fine. Truthfully, we took half the fish home, peeled off the batter coating and fed the fish to the dogs. There's better places to go to for fish and chips: Cloverleaf, Molly Malone's, and Argyle for starters. The fried oysters were probably the best dish we had altogether. If it weren't for the oysters, I wouldn't have given them any stars. Six nicely sized, plump oysters on a bed of horseradish sauce. The horseradish sauce was nice and hot. Was it the best fried oysters I've ever had? No - those honors probably go to Bigelow's in Rockville Centre, Long Island. But, nevertheless, it was still a pleasant dish. Regarding the Caesar Salad, for a restaurant that seems to trying to pursue a comfort food theme, this is awfully pretentious. We tried the mushroom ragout - it was unremarkable. Another mediocre dish tossed onto the discard list. We also found the braised shortribs to be unremarkable. Their chicken breast ""pot pie"" was interesting - almost like a deconstructed chicken pot pie. Regarding their mixed drinks on the menu - their descriptions make them sound interesting. It's a shame the drinks don't deliver. Underwhelming. In the category of MIA, CulinAriane's acclaimed mussels. The reason given my Michael (another item overheard during our first experience): they tried it in Verona initially but making the mussels threw off the kitchen and killed their throughput/productivity. (Hmmmm...they moved a few miles down the road on Bloomfield Avenue but they didn't bring their experienced kitchen crew with them? or...? Other restaurants manage to serve mussels and other dishes without compromising their operation). We tried them once...twice...we see nothing compelling enough to try them a third time.

It was changed over to this place, maybe about a year or two ago. The inside still looks almost the same. The color scheme inside of the restaurant is identical. White, yellow, and black. Sort of looks like a beehive. Their claim to fame is authentic Mexican food. I came here for takeout on taco Tuesdays - 5 tacos for $4.99, and I was allowed to choose up to two meats to mix and match. My choices included pastor (roasted pork), carnitas (pulled pork), or pollo (chicken). I chose the carnitas and pollo. The food was OK, it was nothing special. The meat was a bit dry and didn't have much flavor to it. There weren't many veggies included with my tacos, just onions and tomatoes, which I was disappointed about. The shells were good though. I saw the authenticity of the tacos, by the shells that they came in. I was also given nacho chips with my meal. There was a salsa station there, to fill up, to go cups with mild, medium, and hot salsa. I chose the medium and hot. The medium has an avocado taste to it and the hot was very hot. The chips weren't bad, although the hot sauce didn't have much flavor to it.

Every single person in there were nice and friendly. I loved them all! Let's look at the positives. First, I LOVED the octopus appetizer. Wow. It was a special of the day though, so not sure if they'll have it again. Second, I liked that they have cheese plates. $4 a cheese or $18 for a combo platter. But there were a few things that I just didn't like. The crispy braised pork hock on the menu is specially blocked, as if it's a signature dish. So of course I got that. And it was rather dry... sure, it's crispy. But so dry I couldn't get myself to finish it. My friends all tried it and hated it. It did come with a huge serving of arugula salad, which makes you feel a lot better. My friend had the mussels and fries. Those fries were amazing and they offer so many sauces. But he said the broth did not seep into the mussels so they weren't as tasty as he'd imagined. The bf got a special entree of the day, something along the lines of quail with foie gras and 4 potato chips for $30. I actually liked that dish and wish I got it. So, well done with the specials of the day. Perhaps I will come back for brunch, since the previous Yelp reviews were so good!

And for appetizers, some fried calamari and bbq shrimp. Flavor wise, this place packs a strong punch!  Their crab legs were perfectly seasoned! The clams, soaked a little too much seasoning, they tasted short of overly salty.   The wait time was long, but that was easily forgivable with great tasting seafood and excellent service. Waiters checked in often beginning with tying the necessary bib on, to ending with peeling open a wet nap packet for your hands. Speaking of hands, they provide gloves for your use, but honestly...This gloves give off a funky stink, which if you had a remotely functional nose, messes with your dinner.  My advice, ditch the gloves...This kinda seafood is meant to be dug in with bare hands anyway! For me, besides the small things like stinky blue gloves, this place was nothing short of spectacular.  Everything's on the pricier side of the wallet, but it's quite alright to splurge once in a while for great seafood and great service. 5 stars.

Since I had seen good reviews of this place and it was my first time vising NYC, I made a point of visiting this place. The hostess advised me that I had to wait for half hour, which isnt a bad wait time. I was given a seat after 20mins. The hostess and bartender were super nice. Including the guy that came to give us our bib and gloves! We ordered for Combo#1 which was crawfish and shrimp and for appetizers the bartender recommended us Fried Catfish and boy oh boy...it was the best seafood I had in a very very long time. My boyfriend is Tunisian and I'm Asian so both of us have tried a wide range of seafood but this place was definitely unique and memorable. We had The Boil sauce in Spicy which was AMAZING! I cannot express enough how flavorful and well prepared it was! I made a point of bringing my boyfriend here because of the whole experience of eating out of a bag and being equipped with gloves and midway through the food he says, ""If anyone dies next to me right now, I'm just gonna continue eating"" :D [figuratively, of course]. We returned stuffed, satiated and more than satisfied. The bartender kept checking on us to see if we needed anything and the ambiance and customer service couldn't have been better! The blend of spices in the sauce  (whatever it is) was simply amazing! Next time I come to NYC, I am not leaving without dining at this place AGAIN! I wish the owner expanded his business here in Montreal as well since we do not have something similar here. Happy New Year to everyone of The Boil and keep up the great work! Thank you guys!

Last night, I ordered a chx parm hero and it was not good. There was enough mozzarella on the hero for three sandwiches and the bread was white in color and too soft. The thing that really upset me and will be the main reason I do not go back is their use of salt!  I ordered a pound of sun dried tomatoes that are inedible due to all the salt. The olives were delicious but the stuffed cherry peppers (stuffing, not provolone and prosciutto) were pretty crappy. Some of them looked different from the others.

Ive heard great rumors from friends about this new location that opened up which specialized in grilled cheese plates, both Savory and Sweet. which is not something you find to often...Wait... come to think of it, i don't know of any places that offers sweet grilled cheese sandwiches. Great great stuff! First off, i truly loved the location. This place is perfectly located near most of the bars I go out to, right in the heart of LES on Allen St. The front is covered wall to wall in huge glass window front, with some cool & funny annotations written on them. As I entered with my group, we were greeted by the ever so helpful service. This man took the time to explain the entire menu to us and some of the history behind the beer and wine they serve. I mean this guy truly knew his stuff to say the least. A fellow connoisseur of beer, cheese and wine. I bet he gets all the ladies ""melting"" with that knowledge on his dates. get it... Anyhooooo.... The Food was absolutely delishhh. I split the Crispy Goat and the Sloppy Joe, both savory, scrumptious, and palate pleasers. We ordered the tomato soup to use as dipping sauce (rustic and seasoned well) and the arugula salad to make believe we still ate ""Healthy."" Everything was spot on, but you know what blew my mind... those sweet potato tater tots, some of the best I've ever had. I love sweet potato and everyone loves tater tots.. put those two together and you have yourself a new favorite hang out spot just to have those tots to snack on. oh, and what I loved was that they had beer and wine on tap, and very inexpensively priced at $4-6 for beer on tap. What made my night amazing was the ambiance and the people there. Food was outstanding, service superb, and location is unbeatable. I loved the group tables and the window seats, everything made to comfort. The guy up front was kind enough to let us play Jenga there, mix that with good food, drinks and great company made it definitely a night to remember.

My story begins as such.  My wife had gone there with her girlfriends a month or so before and when we were in the city celebrating new years eve she suggested that we stop for a meal at Eatly.  I was amazed at how AWESOME this place was.  We put our names down for a reservation at their pasta restaurant.  We were told 45 minutes which we were happy to do so we head over to the meat and cheese bar and order a plate of their finest salami and assorted cheese and a couple of classes of pinot noir.  As it turns out our table was ready so much quicker so after quickly canceling our order we headed to our table. Once seated and after reviewing the menu we ordered the mozzarella dish, lobster linguini and two glasses of their house pinot.  The mozzarella was amazingly fresh - almost straight from the COW it was unbelievably delicious.  The lobster linguini - GOOD GOD MAN - was out of this world.  I said above that I love Italian food so I might be going a bit overboard on the review but EFF IT the food was that EFFING good!  To add the wine was divine and helped wash down all that pasta and cheese!

Customer service, on the other hand, needs work. I came in on Saturday evening when it wasn't particularly crowded. The bartender at the time must've been having a particularly bad day, because despite seeing me sit down directly in front of him, he decided to strike up a conversation with his coworker about...wait for it...customers complaining  about bad customer service. Since, it took him 15 minutes to give me a menu, 20 minutes to wait for a 10 minute order, and another 15 minutes for him to realize that the to go order brought out to him was actually mine.

93407,70309,1322,4.0,1,2015-01-09,"There are a few pizzerias that I like in my area, each for different things. Hands down Conte's has the yummiest traditional American pizza, but New World is a close second.  New World's eggplant parm is very delicious and my husband loves their strombolis the best of any place around.  We often order the Caprese salad. It's simple, but with high quality ingredients. Sometimes, depending on who makes it, it is bigger than other times. When it is small, it's too small. My absolute favorite thing to order from New World is their Mozzarella and Tomato focaccia.  OMG!  It is so delicious. It is more delicious than the other focaccias and is made on the same out of this world focaccia roll. Since for a long time New World was the only quality pizzeria that had delivery (I know that Vera's now does, but they are yet to win me over) we mostly ate New World's food.  It's strange that others have complained about the delivery time. We live kind of far from New World and it seems speedy enough to me (30-45 mins). The food is always hot when it arrives. Alfonso's pizza is not as good as New World's, in my opinion, but Alfonso's does make excellent daily specials. They make a little bit fancier dishes in their specials than any other pizza restaurant in the area outside of a more pricey Italian restaurant. Perhaps they can do so since they probably get more business than New World's, but it might be nice if New World would get a little creative from time to time and have a chef's special. Although I have only ever ""eaten in"" at New World's once, I have ordered delivery countless times. I would likely ask about ""specials"" if they'd start to offer them or mention them when you call.   I agree that New World is more of a take out or deliver type of a place.

The broth was flavorful without additional sauces added. The beef was tender and plentiful.

The noodles I had here were cooked to a perfect al dente and springy with every bite. The beef was incredibly tender and had just the right amount of tendon to make it chewy but not tough. I was disappointed by the broth though - over-seasoned to the point of tasting like packaged ramen broth and lacking the complexity that I've found at other noodle shops such as Spicy Village and Lam Zhou Handmade Noodles. The spinach that came with really didn't add much. I would have much rather preferred a generous topping of finely chopped scallions and cilantro.

I ordered a roast beef sandwich and fries with cheese bacon and sour cream which wasn't on the menu but has been in the past. Food came before the drinks because the waitress forgot about us. She then brought my husband soda even though he ordered coffee. My fries had a slice of cheese just thrown on top that looked like it belonged in my daughter's play kitchen. I peeled it off to find bacon bits not even real bacon. So now I'm down to plain fries and sour cream on side. As my story continues keep in mind my roast beef sandwich was priced at 7.95. When the check came I was charged 8.95 for my fries. When I questioned it the waitress directed me to some one else. I asked where the price came from since it wasn't a menu item I was told it came from the other menu when I asked to see it I was told that would not be possible. REALLY? I was also told the old menu price was 7.95 and everything has been raised $1 how would I know that once again I wasn't allowed to see any proof. Disappointed isn't the word disgusted is the word I would use. I highly suggest staying away this place is a scam

Here, they approach the table with a pen ready to write down the menu of the day on the table. The menu changes daily, so the servers verbally give you the list of what the restaurant is serving that day. The downside is that if you are watching your wallet, you won't know how much each dish costs unless you ask the server. The place is very cozy, possibly a good date place since it's really dark and quaint inside. Moving on to the FOOD review.. everything was very flavorful! Pretty much sums up my experience. Nothing was short of salt,  that's for sure, but in a good way. There were a lot of flavor in every dish. I really enjoyed this grilled red cabbage salad. It had a woodsy, fire-grilled, charred taste to the salad, which was very interesting. Over-all, great food and friendly servers.

The best dish we had was the dessert - bitter grapefruit sorbet.  It was really well balanced with bitter, sweet, and sour and provided much-needed lightness after such a fatty, heavy meal. The worst dish was the special of the night.  It was a cassoulet with duck, lamb, and pork.  I imagined a cassoulet with a piece of duck, a piece of pork belly, and maybe a lamb sausage.  Nope!  It was a bowl of slightly undercooked white beans topped with chopped up meat.  Sometimes I worry that the special of the night is a way to use up leftovers from the restaurant.  This was definitely 100% leftovers - just bits of meat that didn't make the cut into other dishes. On top of the food, I wasn't a huge fan of the atmosphere.  Service was professional (although we had one long stretch waiting with no food on the table), but it felt like everyone was too cool for me.  Not especially friendly or attentive.

Our hostess who greeted us was attentive and gracious, accommodating us to a booth that just went vacant, and everything went downhill from there. Re: the server staff, she made it a point to let us know this was her third day of working a double shift and made sure we understood her concerns, rather than focus in on her table. The prior two visits, the server staff was gracious, but hardly went out of their way to ensure we experienced something special here. On two out of the three occasions we visited, we waited at least 25 minutes for our meal, with our most recent visit, 40 minutes, despite the restaurant not overflowing in capacity. Only once during that period of time did our server make it a point to let us know they are short staffed.  I had the ""Grazer"" burger, and although okay, it was bland, small in size, and the burger certainly does not justify its price. Just to provide some perspective, on our three visits, we spent an average of $35.00 for two burgers, and an ice tea, with a small upgrade in our fries. The fries were good, and have to rate them above average, however, nothing I can't get at some other local eateries who choose to cut their fries fresh. In paying for the bill, each server has an I- phone and what looks like a ""square"" paying mechanism, which is nice touch, however, as the server is standing over you, I have to decide on the proper gratuity on their I phone, which I think is an invasion of my privacy and decision making. One more item worth noting, for a relatively new restaurant, their rest rooms were far from clean. Overall, Grazers has been a major disappointment to us. This is a great location, right next to the theater, the concept is a solid one for this area, but to make this a successful venture, my take is to have your servers take a refresher course on Customer service, create a burger that is equivalent in size to the price, add some flavor to the burger,  and by all means, provide an option where you as a guest can be afforded some privacy in deciding on the proper gratuity.

My girlfriend got the shrimp salad and I tasted one of the shrimp and it was good.

First thing's first, I must comment on the two random, unimportant-in-the-grand-scheme-of-things details that ultimately won me over. 1. The bread, which is delicious on its own, is served with olive oil with a crushed roasted garlic clove in it. BE MORE DELICIOUS- OH WAIT, YOU CAN'T. Bread everywhere else now dims in comparison. 2. Sent us home with two lil packets of pumpkin seeds. Ya know, cause the place is called Pumpkin. How cute are you? On to the food. We ordered: spanish rock octopus- this was good, garlicky, and not weird and rubbery the way I always imagined octopus would taste before I became an adult and decided not to judge things I've never even eaten. wild duxbury mussels- these were over-the-top good, but I can't tell if that's just because I was majorly craving mussels. Broth was saffron/vermouth/dijon mustard, and was also an excellent vehicle for bread-dipping. striped bass- i ordered this solely because it was served with white beans. I'm talkin big, buttery white beans cooked to perfection. It was served in a lightly herbed broth and came with rapini, which I found a little bitter. The fish, though, was fantastic. Perfectly cooked and not overly fishy. arctic charr- my boyfriend ordered this because the description said 'borscht, horseradish and smoked turnip'. Not so sure how/where the borscht was involved in this one, but the fish was, again, very tasty. side of potatoes- these came plain, roasted with olive oil and lightly salted. Good, but could have been more flavorful. Pricewise, slightly on the more expensive side, but could be worse. Our bill was $100 for everything above. I probably would have given this place 3 1/2 stars if that was an option, but I will definitely come back and order differently to get a fuller picture of how I feel about it. For sure worth trying, though.

102742,75688,934,2.0,1,2015-01-04,"Service: HORRIBLE. The reason for only two stars is pretty much because of the service (and the fact that I've heard awesome things about the food, but I was not impressed).  Five of my girlfriends and I came on a Saturday night and had 8:45 reservations, but were not seated until 9:00.  Once seated, the waiter nicely opened our wine for us and gave us time to look at the menu.  He finally came back to take our order and my friend asked if the chef could possibly make sure that none of what she ordered is placed anywhere near the hazelnut dish that they had on the menu that night (my friend is severely allergic to hazelnuts). The waiter then processed to say ""well I haven't killed anyone yet, so I'm sure you'll be fine."" I'm sorry, WHAT? Actually, she could definitely die if anything that she ate was close to a hazelnut, but thanks for your concern douche.   Our food came out in a reasonable time, but the waiter forgot one of our sides which came out and was disgusting (see the butternut squash review below). Once we were done our dinners, the server cleared the table and we proceeded to enjoy our wine and have the usual after dinner girl talk. Around 10:45, we were having a good conversation and a random server came out and started clearing ALL of our water and wine glasses.  I mean EVERYTHING. I had wine left in my glass and he grabbed it from in front of me stating, ""I just want to get all of these in the dishwasher thanks."" Again. IM SORRY WHAT? It was now 11:15 and the restaurant doesn't close until 12:00.  I then asked for my glass back and we all finished the rest of the wine by sharing from this one glass since but cleared everyone else's.  At this point I was going to stay until 12:00am on the dot just because I was so annoyed.  The kicker was  around 11:40 when our server brought us our jackets and said, ""I am just going to put these on the table behind you."" We finally decided to chug our wine and get the F out. Needless to say, I will not be going back there and believe that this place is completely overrated. Food: JUST OK. The appetizers were pretty good. We shared the mussels and the burrata. The mussels were amazing actually, but burrata was eh. We also ordered the roasted butternut squash as a side, which was not good. It  tasted sour and honestly there was no one at the table who didn't spit it out. As for entrees, two of my friends ordered the sea bass, which they believed was undercooked and in a weird red sauce. Two of us had the steak, which was probably the best entree out of them all. The sear was amazing.  I also  tasted the pork dish that my friend got and had good flavor, but I wasn't overly impressed. Anyway, I really don't write a lot of reviews on here, but felt I needed to considering how excited I was to eat here and how disappointed I am now.

I've eaten the Butcher steak, 45oz ax handle, lamb chops, three different eggplants, monster prawns, clams, classic patty melt, pan fried mashed potatoes, spinach, fingerling potatoes  gratin ( not all at the same time). Butchers steak is my fav hands down. Med or Med rare it's all good with the garlic butter. Well done comes out a bit burnt. Ax handle is good but not as flavorful as the butcher in my opinion. Lambchops were good but nothing unique about it. Eggplant app is small but the unique flavors together is worth trying. Monster prawns are huge and deserving of being called monster.

But they still have waiting service, so we were seated and perused our options. A rarity, boyfriend and I got the same thing: shakshuka with freshly squeezed orange juice. While we waited for it to arrive, we noted that most of the seats allow for great people watching and we watched the varied crowds of the LES dash by in the snow storm. Our dishes arrived in cast-iron skillets with pita and tahini on the side. We dug in and it was scrumptious. Generous portions, the sauce still bubbling slightly from being so freshly baked. I ordered some additional pita because it needed some more for dipping and scraping purposes (diet be damned!) Overall, it's a laidback, unpretentious brunch spot that doubles as a cafe. Because there are so, so, so few of those in New York, I have to recommend it highly and suggest you also venture into the LES for this gem.

For the appetizer she has the onion soup and I ordered the raviole. She has had french onion soup before but this was the best if not perfect . The raviole was light and not fishy at all . For our entrées she ordered the pheasant  which again was cooked to perfection. The quenelle wasn't so far off either. Perfectly crispy from the outside and melt in your mouth from the in side . For dessert we had the pineapple cake and the chocolate ala mode brownie . Definitely going back again

Whatsmore is the Office has  sister restaurants in Ridgewood and Cranford, both of which are slightly better than the Montclair site. It's odd to say this but, the Office is a dingier Applebees. The decor is bland, whooden tables, dirty rugs and TVs everywhere. The service is meh. The servers are not rude, but are also not helpful. The food is lame, their burgers are covered in greasy and are poorly cooked. I mean how hard is it to cook a medium well burger. The fries are okay though... Also, I feel that the food is overpriced due to the fact that the quality is so poor. The bar is it's saving grace. The office's bar is large with a large selection of well drinks and beers. The bartenders, however, are slow. The overall vibe of the office is laidback. However, that may because it is progressively becoming a college bar as opposed to a pub. If I had a choice between Applebees and the office I would pick the former hands down.

It is probably because of the fresh crab meat and the pasta paired with white wine and garlic sauce was much better than the tomato sauce. - Farfalle Di Spiaggia - bow tie pasta with lobster, shrimp, fresh green peas and avocado in a parmigiano cream sauce. The pasta was pretty good. I liked the addition of avocado. - Complimentary bread with balsamic vinegar and olive oil to start. We were starving so this helped curb our hunger. I know it might be weird but the bread taste better with some balsamic vinegar in the mix. - Generous portions. OKAY: - Black Taglierini (squid ink pasta) - I had to tried this after hearing such great things about this. Pasta was alright. It was cooked al dente but a little on the firm side. First time having squid ink pasta and it taste like regular pasta. Maybe it's just me. I liked the green peas, sun-dried tomato and shrimp. I think the pasta would have tasted better with a different type of sauce instead of tomato sauce. The tomato sauce they used reminds me a bit of the vodka sauce that I had at another place. - Ravioli was pretty good but I feel like its good only for two pieces before you get tired of the taste. - Elderflower Spritz - alcohol content is very low. It's like sprite with elderflower syrup. I like this one more than the Bellini though. - Bellini - (peach nectar and prosseco) - Good. You can actually taste the alcohol in this one compared to the elderflower spritz. - Soup of the day - waiter told us it was made with escargot but when it came there wasn't actually any snails in there. It was just broth. Taste was average. Nothing special. CONS: - Place is SMALL and tightly PACKED. It made getting in and out of your seat very uncomfortable.

For having only 2 functioning grills - the grill master was able to turn the burgers around pretty quickly. So my review of the burgers. 1 - two slices of white toast instead of buns... not really feeling it. it was too weak to support the... 2 - decent size, nicely seasoned meat. This was the best part of the burger. It was seasoned very well and it tasted very well charred and fresh. Best part of the burger. 3 - cheese - basic american cheese. 4 - I tried both onion and tomato. The onion they grill with the burger while the tomato is placed fresh. Honestly, you only need the onion. Bonus round: The soda was really good! Foxon park. Local soda. Get it. The potato salad was also very good. Big chunks of egg. It definitely had a nice kick. Save your soda and potato salad so you can enjoy with your meal... I ate most of my potato salad and almost finished my drink while waiting. It's in the heart of Yale. Nice place. Definitely a tourist place. Glad I checked it off my list but wouldn't drive or wait for the burger. Enjoyed the experience.

Located on a gorgeous stretch of shops on Church Street, Raymond's is easy to pass by and dismiss as some generic eatery, but that would be a mistake.  Inside there is a bar where you can sit and eat on the right while booths line the walls and tables are set in the middle.  White tile covers the walls and a metal ceiling shows off a wonderfully retro pattern.  Vintage bottles line shelves in the middle of the restaurant and the booths have lights built into them, making them reminiscent of old steakhouses and dinner clubs of the past.  Quite simply, even before I had a bite of food this place had me captivated. We were seated fairly quickly and after a quick look at the menu, it wasn't hard to choose what I wanted.  Here's the breakdown: CORN BATTER PANCAKES The name says it all.  Imagine pancakes, but with cornmeal worked in.  The result is a sweet pancake with a slightly chewy texture, and I mean that in a *good* way.  The pancakes were absolutely delicious and honestly didn't need syrup.  The platter comes with a small serving of fruit, which is a nice touch. EGGS & GRITS Sunnyside eggs with house-made chorizo and Jersey grits.  This was the star dish of the brunch!  The grits were cooked perfectly, the eggs on top were done brilliantly (with yolk that I wound up integrating into the grits) and the chorizo tied everything together.  There are also some tortilla chips added in for texture.  The final result is a wonderful sweetness and saltiness all at once. BELGIAN HOT CHOCOLATE A wonderful cup of hot chocolate that you can request spiced.   It included a *giant* cube of marshmallow.  The chocolate flavor was deep, sweet and wonderful.  The marshmallow added extra flavor and smoothness.  Overall a crazy but ""fun once in a while"" drink. My first experience at Raymond's was spectacular and I look forward to going back in the future!

I only had 150 followers and got maybe 25 likes on each post, and that was on a good day. All of that changed when my bff and I went to Raymond's. She ordered a breakfast salad, and I ordered French Toast. While waiting for our food to arrive, I looked around and really started to appreciate the vintage feel of the world around me. The mason jars, the colored bottles, the old-style tables and seats, and even the booths, all made everything seem so attractive. So... picturesque. I was slowly getting lost in my artsy surroundings when the waiter arrived with our food. OH. MY. GOD. This plate of French Toast was just.... Ugh.... Like..... I can't even omg. Like really literally I can't even wtf. Ugh. What. But then it hit me. What if my friends somehow saw this gorgeous plate of French Toast I was about to consume... And then maybe.... Maybe they, as well, would not be able to even...? What if I found a way to share this with my friends and have it look so good that they get... #jealous? Was there a way to do this? Five minutes of my staring at my plate passed, when suddenly the idea struck me. Maybe... maybe I should gram this. I snapped a really nice picture of the toast with some of the colored bottles in the background, because without the colored bottles, is it even Raymond's? After getting a poppin picture I chose the filter. I thought about going X-Pro and gettin a little vintage, but decided against it. I mean, everyone knows that you go Valencia or go home. Added it to the photo map, again, just so everyone knew I was at Raymonds, and not some second-class not-Raymond's restaurant. Threw in #raymonds #yum #eatingwithbae #foodporn and #yas, and called it done. Posted it to the gram, locked my phone, and dug into my delicious french toast. After the meal, we walked out into the chilly air of a January on Church Street. My phone started buzzing, so I took it out of my pocket and figured out that the buzzing was from Instagram. 46 LIKES AND 5 COMMENTS? WHAT HAPPENED? Shocked by this development, I looked at my post. The comments, including ""ugh"", ""hot damn"", and ""ihu"", were unlike any I'd ever seen before. What does ihu even mean?? Long story short, I learned what everything meant pretty quickly and was thrilled with how much going to Raymond's improved my insta game. I now go there regularly, and have started bring my other friends and even bae along to come gram with me. Without Raymond's, I'd be a complete nobody with the weakest insta game out.

I did see bartenders take shots though, which is unprofessional.

Unfortunately, my date was having some problem with his stomach so he only got a soup, which, according to him, was very delicious. (Winter soup) I ordered duck and waffle since it seemed super popular on yelp. It was a big chunk of fried duck meat on top of a non-traditional waffle. But I loved the waffle. This dish is like a combo of entree+dessert for me. The partially caramelized super buuttery cake-like waffle tasted great by itself and also went along with the savory duck. My only complaint is that it's difficult to cut the food nicely and eat it elegantly (but who cares lol). As much as I enjoyed the food at that time, I noticed that I was drinking water nonstop the whole night, so I guess the food was a little bit on the salty side. I also had a Sparkle and Shine per our waiter's recommendation. I like the multi-layer sensation of this cocktail and the subtle vanilla flavor from the vanilla bean.

Next, we ordered Grilled Hangar Steak which came out so raw that the meat was still cold! Mind you, I was never asked to what preference I'd like the meat cooked. I figured that's how it was prepared and tried a few bites, I couldn't continue because it just tasted like something wasn't right. I brought this to the attention of the waitress and she said offered to have the meat cooked properly. The meat was presented very nicely, but it was already sliced so the chef had to have seen that it was barely cooked, I like my steak rare, but this was barely seared and cold AF! Anyways, we didn't mind too much, it was delicious once the chef cooked it thoroughly. Lastly we had the Spumoni which was amazing paired to perfection with their cheesecake.

I REPEAT, DO NOT miss Cuba.  Having grown up in a Puerto Rican family that loves to eat, I know how authentic Latin home cookin' should taste.  Trust me, my Grandmother constantly yelled at me to eat more because I was ""too skinny""... so I've eaten more than my share.   This used to be my go-to spot to bring a date.  Now it's the go-to brunch spot for my girlfriend and I (just don't tell her I've brought other girls here before I met her).  There was a period of time where we went for brunch pretty much every single Sunday.  Brunching every Sunday was not always in our budget, but Cuba is so reasonably priced that it was a no-brainer as far as bang for our buck.  I even threw my Dad's surprise 65th birthday party n the private downstairs room (for private parties this place is incredibly accommodating and reasonable as well).  The staff is so friendly that they treat me like a family member since I've been a regular for so many years, shaking my hand and giving my girlfriend hugs on our way in.  As I observe them with the buzzing brunch crowd I realize, they're just as nice to anyone who steps through that door.   Not only is the staff incredibly warm and friendly, but they are ATTENTIVE.  It's a true unlimited boozy brunch where the drinks are STRONG and flowing.  They refill you every chance they get, so be prepared for the rest of your day to be a wash if you have anything important to do (like I said, bang for your buck).  The red Sangria is my jam, flavorful and potent.  Not too sweet, not too strong.  Just right!  Come here with a date, come here with a group of friends ready to party,  hell come with your family.  It is perfect for any occasion.  Between the artwork on the walls, or the lively sounds of Cuban music pumping through the stereo... you will feel like you just hopped off the plane in Havana for an extended vacation.  What a great escape from the city!  Just try to remember where you really are after your Sangria is done. As for the food, they cook with the perfect amount of flavor.  Seriously, it's perfect.  Nothing overwhelms the palette.  It's JUST right.  All ingredients are fresh and compliment each other with flawless flavor.  Meats are tender and juicy.  Delicious EVERYTHING.  Here are the dishes I've tried:  Ropa Vieja, Arroz Con Pollo, Camarones, Empanadas, Yuca Frita, Tostones Con Mojo,  Rollito de Pollo, Marinero, Bistec A Caballo, Huevos rancheros, Flan.  Here is a description for all of them.  BOMB. BOMB BOMB and BOMB.  For real.  KABOOM.  Head explosion goodness.  My girlfriend is an Irish girl from South Boston, and I swear to God she started speaking Spanish out of no where during one of our meals.  It's that good.   I know this review was probably all over the place, I blacked out while writing it.  I just have so many good things to say that I couldn't organize my thoughts.  Just get out there and try it already.  You won't be disappointed!

The sauce was very good.. kind of sweet. The crust was way too think for me. Classic NYC pizza is thin crust with some charring on the bottom.  Further, the crust should have a snap to it although one you can fold. I would give this pizza a decent B to B-..  Lombardi's, the new Grimaldi's, and Patsy's are much better in my opinion...

I have eaten at their location & they have recently installed a new wooden bar which is lovely right when you walk in. There is a separate room with tables, and waiter service. I ordered the shrimp soft tacos (comes w/3 tacos, salsa - red or green per your request, and grillled cactus & baby onions). My son had the burrito & we shared the guac & chips - all very good although I thought the shrimp could have been more well spiced. Today we ordered lunch at my office - I again ordered the shrimp tacos & after putting the salsa verde on it, it was delicious. My co-worker ordered chicken mole & she said it was good but not great as it had too much sauce on it. Overall, the food is good, hearty, & portions are large. It is not fine dining, but is good quality Mexican food that is local AND delivers.

I also loved that we could stand in front of the gleaming coolers of beer bottles.  It was so helpful to walk up and down the aisle and see the beer so we could  discuss our choices.  With such a large selection to choose from, it can be intimidating to have to pick  from a menu, without actually seeing the bottles.  We even got into a conversation with a stranger and suggested beers to each other to try.  It was a great experience and we will be back.

It was cozy and warm when I arrived and I was happy when they sat us at a small table near the fireplace. Their menu is decent, I was bummed out they didn't have any Chinese eggplant dishes, but that's neither here nor there. We started off with their vegetable spring rolls for a starter, it came with 4 spring rolls, crispy on the outside with duck sauce on the side. They were good, exactly what I expected. After that, I decided to go with the classic Pad See Eiw, delicious stir fried huge flat noodles with Chinese broccoli and your choice of meat. If you've never had this dish, you need to try it. It's the perfect dish on a cold winter day. After dinner I had a Thai iced tea, so good. Love them. The food was good overall, I was just a little bummed out by the service. When we sat, the quickly brought us water and gave us wine glasses, but it took awhile to get our food and even longer to get the bill and the place wasn't even that crowded! Overall, a little bummed they don't deliver, but I would go back. Hopefully the 'not so great service' was just a fluke!

I finally tried the Melt Shop in NYC and my sister and I both loved it. The sucky part is that you have to wait outside in the cold winter until your order is ready. There are indoor dining tables nearby though. The price is relatively cheap, but the portions aren't big either. I don't know how they grill their sandwiches that makes them so different from homemade ones, but they definitely taste way better with combos in texture. The day I went here, the guy who was taking my order said half the things we asked for was either ""not available"" or ""not ready"". Even the milkshake was ""unavilable because it's not ready""....whatever that means... This was around 1pm on a Sunday... I really think the guy was being lazy... but who knows. Anyways, back to the sandwich, the load of cheese oozing out and the crispy grilled toasts are what makes these different. But some of them has too much cheese and makes the sandwich too salty. I am sensitive to salt however, so you may find it just perfect. It's on the greasy side so it'll be good for hangover food too :) Even on a cold windy day customers would come non-stop, so this probably tells you something about Melt Shop too.

Granted this was our first visit to Barbuzzo, so take what I say with a grain of salt. Anyone can have a bad day. The Man and I were part of the line out the door for last Monday's lunch crowd. Normally we would have been more planful, but we were fresh off the morning train from DC and the wind was rather cold. We lined up. Fortunately for us, because we were there early (11:45 ish), we made it in to one of the (seemed to be) three available tables for customers without reservations. TIP #1: Reserve a table, even at lunch, even on a Monday. We were seated by the front door, with heavy curtains partially shielding us from a mostly open door. It was a good bit warmer than outside but, related to TIP #1, reservations are key at Barbuzzo. We ordered quickly and our server was attentive. We started with marinated olives, the soup that day (which was a carrot -sumac), and drinks--beer for the man and a prosecco mixer (French Farmer) for me. TIP #2: Order drinks here. My prosecco was lovingly mixed with elderflower and had a cranberry floating on top. Beautiful, and having just the one felt like a net gain. For our mains, Hubs opted for the classic margherita pie. I had the seasonal  orecchiette, which was theoretically to be served with roasted tomatoes, chourico, and greens. It took quite some time to get our food, despite being one of the first to order. When the food came out, it looked as though we had ordered it in a bad food court. Man's pizza was flat, a little black on the crust. The only saver was the sauce (TIP #3). We both thought that was the best part of the meal. My pasta, on the other hand, looked as though it had been thrown in to the bowl--there was slop on the side, it just didn't look ""restaurant worthy""--even though I never knew that would bother me. Turns out the pasta didn't taste any better than it looked. Also, it had no roasted tomatoes in it! Just about 1/3 c. of olive oil, the sausages (4 coins, to be exact), and some tiny pieces of chard. I asked our server about the tomatoes, and she said she'd let the kitchen know. About 15 minutes later, I got a cold dish of very oily, very cold tomatoes. Sad! Good for our server, she took the $13 off our bill. But still, $70 bucks later, we felt we could have done better at the pizza shop across 13th. So, what did I learn? When dining at Barbuzzo: 1) make a reservation, 2) order a drink, and 3) get the pizza.

Started off with the sheep's milk ricotta-- was buttery and the balsamic/ olive oil dressing really complimented it nicely. Went with the Girasole pizza and Clams & Chorizo for our main dishes; the pizza had nice balance and flavor, though was really runny (only blip, and not sure why it was falling apart because the crust was perfection). The clams, well they deserve their own sentence: so, so, so good and served up in a heaping portion. Oh, and the dessert...the dessert... salted caramel budino. This was, bar none, the best dessert I have ever had. Just get it. We took an additional one to go (and considered stopping by for a couple more before heading back to NY-- we'll be back) 2. Decor was really interesting. Had a little farmhouse aesthetic going on with some barrel-themed light fixtures and big barn doors for contrast. Dig it. 3. Service was impeccable. Everyone was bringing their A-game. Waitress even took the time to have a 5-minute convo at the end of the meal to key us into Philly's nightlife (her recommendations did not disappoint, particularly the Ranstead Room and Franklin Mortgage & Investment Co.). The bad: 1. Nada. Not a blemish to be spoken of, excluding the pizza needing a little more crunch. The unexpected: 1. Clumsy me managed to spill a cocktail and a healthy portion of ice all over myself (turned bright red). Was promptly cleaned up and I ordered a beer. The waitress came back with a beer and... my previous drink, filled precisely to the point at which it was spilled. I was super impressed and taken back by that level of detail. Like I said-- service was impeccable.

And then I knew what perfection meant, how it felt, tasted, looked. It was in the form of 2 pieces of bread covered in what appeared to be caramelized apples. But then you bite into it, and you knew it was meant to be! That connection between that bite and your soul was all worth it. Ok, now that that's done I'll review everything else. Mimosa was a bit pricy and not worth it in my opinion. But the burger was delicious; I got it with everything, egg, bacon, cheddar. And those fries with curry mayo were absolutely delicious.

Flavors unlike anything I had ever tasted before. My mouth actually starts to water as I remember the juicy cuts of meat, giant rice dishes in iron pots, rich garlic sauces, crispy sausage, and the hand cut potato chips that never seemed to end. Pin-Nic Bar & Restaurant brings all these memories back with each bite. The churrasco skirt steak was seasoned to perfection and fork tender. The large portion was enough for my family of 7 to all get a nice piece. High recommend! The paella rice is so tasty I couldn't stop helping myself, but the real highlight of the meal were the clams Portuguese style. A basket of bread and a heaping pot of the clams cooked in a rich garlic red sauce will have you planning your next visit. Not to mention the cuts of chorizo that are hidden deep inside the sauce. After the first order, we decided to double dip and get a second. The sangria here was also very excellent. Red and White both tasty. Red was less sweet, if you have a preference.

Let's consider the evidence: 1) 4 Months ago there were nearly zero reviews for the place. Now, 150+? 2) Their sushi is average at best. In the 5th most populous city in the country, that this average sushi place would be rated 4.5/5 stars, among the likes of amazing restaurants like Zama, Doma, and Umai Umai is laughable and makes it clear that this is fabricated. 3) The service is horrible. The owner often sits up front browsing the internet while his untrained waitstaff (family?) mess about and or make major mistakes in orders. 4) They often run lunch specials or free appetizers for local students/doctors but try to charge or won't give it unless odd stipulations are met. Overall I'm really disappointed that they clearly went this route to drum up business instead of improving the quality of their food. I seriously recommend you look elsewhere for sushi/Japanese food!

Fun rolls, a few entrees and apps AND it's byo!   I just wished they brought out the entrees at the same time because the teriyaki came out a few or more minutes before mine, and my finace gobbled it up pretty quickly and watched me eat my dish for a while.  Good thing he doesn't crave raw fish so I didn't have to get all food agro and eat it quickly before he stole all the pieces.

The cheese/meat board offers 3-4 thin, see-through slices that are okay-ish for one person at best. 3. The bravas fries were tasty. So was the steak tapas. Were they worth $8 and, respectively, $22? I had entres (2x larger portions) of either for the same price. 4. The garlic shrimp was meh. Really nothing interesting, and the sauce tasted like marinara out of a can.   5.

I tried the bbq short ribs, were a lil dry not that great may've sat too long.   I've only dined in the front and done take-out.  It's very neat and clean, cute decor and the staff is very friendly and accommodating.  Much on the menu to try and reason to come back.

Eighty percent meat, 20 percent fat. If I had to guess, I'd say the ground beef at BurgerFi was cheaper still. Burger King tastes much better than what I was served. That's sad. Service was great, and the guy behind the counter was polite and helpful--almost too helpful, valiantly trying to up-sell me on everything from the fries to happy hour.

The size of the pizzas: they are a little big for one and a little big for 2 to share. If you get bruschetta first, 2 people can share one. The mozzarella salads are excellent. I've never tried the panini. The space is tiny, so you may have to wait. There's an outdoor area in the summer, but I've never seen this place anything but crowded, so unless you come at a weird time, you may have some time before you get seated. It's worth the wait. Or...they do takeout!

The ingredients are fresh, and every pie is made with love. My sister and new brother-in-law introduced me to this place as ""Tino's"" because they dined here so frequently, that became close with one of the owners, Tino! We always feel like family when we eat here. And growing up eating very rustic Italian food--courtesy of my Grandma and Poppi--I know good pizza when I have it ;) Nothing really came close to their homemade dishes until I ate here.

You can create your own, or go for one of their imaginative and delicious options on the menu. There are other menu items, but we're there for the pizza, so really didn't notice what was on offer.

First off, the atmosphere, throw back at it's finest.  It is literally like stepping in a time machine and being transported back to the 1930's.  They have staff members who dress the part and walk and dance to truly make the vibe come to life. The entertainment is great as well. During dinner they have a live jazz band and after there is a performance.  But let's talk about food shall we? For appetizers, we got the brussel sprout kebabs, the kale cesaer salad, and the mussels.  All were delicious.  The brussel sprouts were a combination of fruit, cheese, spouts, and molasses; very different, very tasty.  The kale salad was good, but the leaves were too big (they needed to be cut before serving) which is made semi difficult to eat, but I would order it again.  The mussels were great. Again, the flavors were not something I am accustomed to, but they worked. For entrees, we ordered the flat iron steak, the special which was a whole Porgy, and twice fried fries.  The steak was phenomenal, a perfect medium rare with the right amount of salt and pepper.  A winner beyond belief.   The porgy, not so much.  Unfortunately the porgy was slightly fishy and was lacking seasoning.  Just not my cup of tea. The twice fried fries were also a winner, I LOVE crispy seasoned fries. One last comment, and what made it easy to give the Heath 4 out of 5 stars.  The chef is obsessed with parsley! The presentation of the entrees was lacking to say the least.  Each entrée was covered in parsley, I couldn't even see my steak! Remember that all the senses are involved in the enjoyment of meal, and would have loved to see the entrees plated in a more elegant way to let the protein to be the star, but the garnish. All in all, I would certainly come back. In fact, I plan to bring my parents here as I know they would love it.

I can actually finish everything I order without feeling gross after. The flavor of everything is very ""clean"" - not as much salt/pepper/spices added, which I love but most people probably prefer more. Definitely try: 1. Congee - I always get the mustard green and pumpkin. It's more Hong Kong style - so not too much condiments are added, but that's how I like my congee. 2. Soup dumplings - one of my favorite places for soup dumplings. They are different from Joe's Shanghai but still worth trying. The soup is the bomb! 3. Noodle soups - the wonton soup and beef noodle soup are my fav, but the meat is cooked inconsistently. Sometimes it's perfectly soft and yummy, but I've had a few occasions where the meat was too rough and chewy.

The lunch menu provides a good value, the quality of the food is questionable. Yes, you will get large portions, but you will also get lots of sodium and not-so-natural processed options. The green juice is ok. The atmosphere leaves much to be desired as it is completely devoid of character.

A few years back, Jamonera took its place, an ode to Spanish tapas and wine bar. As with most of Chef Turney's restaurants, the two-tops can be crammed, but overall Jamonera boasts a warm space, with lots of red. Sangria Blanca [$9] Spanish white wine, citrus, gingery syrup   The GF started off with some white sangria. The ginger was really pronounced, which mellowed out any overt citrus and sweetness. Nice. Pedro's Garden [$12] Bourbon, El Maestro Sierra PX, balsamic, ginger, basil Even better was this Bulleit bourbon-based tipple. The sherry imparted a nice mix of spices on the nose, with the caramel undertones supporting the subtly sweet bourbon. As a countervailing element, the balsamic provided some tartness with the basil and ginger coming through on the end. Crispy Cana de Cabra [$9] Fried goat cheese, roasted beets, spinach, grapefruit, pickled fig jam Here's your prototypical beet salad, served up with a huge disc of goat cheese. While the fig jam wasn't apparent, the grapefruit was a nice tart marriage with the sweet beets. Butternut Squash Croquettas [$8] Urgelia cheese, brown butter-marcona almond sauce, brussel leaf-apple salad The croquettas were crisp and light, with the brown butter marcona almond sauce bringing deeper flavors than expected. The apple brought some fresh tartness to each bite, with the cheese providing some salt. Papa Frita [$6] Crispy skin potato, wood smoked garlic aioli, brava salt, house made sherry vinegar-hot sauce Pretty much a must-order at Jamonera, it's no surprise why it's often featured at the Midtown Village Festival at the Jamonera booth. Crispy and well-fried, these potatoes are served with a garlic aioli on top and some house-made sherry-vinegar hot sauce that should be bottled and sold in a store near you. Seared Scallops [$17] Celery root puree, pork belly, scarlet baby turnip, warm chorizo-sherry vinaigrette   The quartet of scallops had a nice salty sear, with the crisp pork belly and chorizo-sherry vinaigrette providing heft to each bite. The roasted red peppers balanced it all with some sweetness. Pan Seared Hangar Steak [$17] Romesco, manchego, mushroom escabeche, salt roasted potatoes The seasoning on the charred medium-rare steak was spot on. The escabeche provided a nice vinegary brightness for each bite, with crispy salt-roasted potatoes accompanying this dish. Berenjenas [$7] Crispy eggplant fries, smoked tomato salmorejo, truffle honey, zamarano cheese The crispy eggplant fries were really nice, with some sweet cinnamon coming through, along with the truffle honey. The creamy eggplant simply melted in your mouth, with the light tempura batter providing some texture. The salmorejo puree added some acidity to each bite. In typical Turney-Safran fashion, Jamonera shines another bright light on 13th Street and their Midtown Village kingdom. There are a variety of offerings for all of your tapas needs and you could easily get full on 3-4 plates between two people. But why would you want to stop there?

The staff here is really as good as it gets.  I explained my restrictions and they put all my anxieties at bay.  They explained to me that off-menu items are no problem at all, and they are more than happy to recommend, adjust, twist, and bend the menu to fit my crazy dietary needs.  Our sweet waitress did that with absolutely no hint of weirdness, with no judgement at all about it; her only concern was that I had a good meal that didn't make me ill at the end of it.   The food is fresh and delicious.  The service is amazing.  To my gluten-free, dairy-free, and whatever-free peeps, this is an awesome place to go for a night out!

The Godzilla roll was very good, it was filled with fresh tasting tuna, crab, avocado, deep fried, then covered in roe and spicy mayo. It came with 8 large pieces, very good rool. The Philly roll was done right, they didn't skimp on the fish which is nice. the gyoza were also good, albeit cold by the time they arrived.

This place did it's job in leaving an impression- but a bad one at that. My boyfriend and I both had high hopes for this place but it left us nothing but a bad taste in our mouth-yes: literally. We came here on a Friday night, packed to say the least but a table just opened up for us in the front near the bar. As soon as I sat down, a gust of hot wind and heat was blowing from the vents coming down to my seat. I quickly asked if the waiter could seat us at another table but was told there were no other tables available. He went to turn the heat down, and all was fine, until two minutes later, it started blowing hot air again. Not a pretty picture throughout my meal. My boyfriend and I shared the 'Crab Fried Rice in Coconut' as our appetizer since we heard such great reviews of the item and both ordered Pad Thai's. I chose the seafood combination and he chose the chicken. First, the fried rice was OK. There was barely ANY crab meat in the rice, along with the fact that the rice was barely warm. The coconut is a creative concept, and appearance wise is beautiful, but overall for taste- mediocre at best. Definitely not worth $18 bucks. My Pad Thai seafood combination came with calamari, shrimp and salmon. I was a little more impressed with my entree since the dish itself came with at least a 4 oz. portion of fish! Most places will skimp out on portion size so this was a big yes for me. But yes, of course there's a downside to this- the calamari was horrible. It was overcooked and rubbery. My wild guess is- the calamari used in the dish is probably used most often for their fried calamari as appetizers so they barely took mind into making this item on the menu edible to say the least since all this would result in is a toss in a 410F deep fryer to result in a texture more delectable. UGH. It was taking me more of an effort to get a bite into the pieces so I gave that up. My boyfriend also described his chicken as overcooked and tough as well. We both didn't finish our dishes but we are never ones to waste food so we asked the waiter if they would wrap up the plates and bring us the check. To our displeasure, when getting home, we realized that both unfinished dishes were placed into ONE to-go container. I am strictly pescetarian so my portion of the food was put to waste since I prefer not to consume any food that has been dealt with meat items. I was pretty disappointed at this point even though I felt like my expectations were already down the drain when we paid the check. Out of all my experiences in dining out, I've never had the waiter mess up on wrapping up leftover food. Seriously?To say the least, this place is not worth the hype. That's one out of the books for me.

The quality of the food is the same since it reopened but the recipes that I fell in love with 7 years ago when I first moved to Philadelphia have changed. My favorite is the Enchiladas verde. Before they were served with tofu but with the reopening, they are now served with mushrooms. I love mushrooms so I don't mind it but I do miss the way they prepped the tofu. It was amazing. The BYOB Lolita used to have fresh fruit margarita pitcher mixers and you bring your own Tequilla. That has changed now but luckily they still offer some fresh fruit margarita pitchers that aren't loaded with sugar and you can actually taste the fruit. Lolita's will always be one of my favorite philly restaurants.

I went here with my family whilst on our way to the tenement museum and the following is why we will never go back:   1. We went off peak, Monday around 1:45. The GM wanted us to sit in the middle of two other tables when a ""larger"" space at the corner was available. We initially were denied the table at the end because it can ""fit"" 5 instead of 4.  I dont know HOW 5 people would fit but i suppose if everyone in your party is 5ft, 115lbs and under you can make it work. After a stern argument with the GM and the threat of walking out we finally got the table we requested (which was EMPTY by the way). 2. The seating is VERY uncomfortable.  This restaurant is all about the bottom line. Their portions are small, the tables are the size of an average nightstand, and everyone is on top of each other. We literally were on top of our neighboring table 3. The food was AWFUL. I got the Brussel Sprout & quinoa. The sprouts were BURNT. It was awful. The food was bland. Its basically bar food when you are extremely drunk. But if you are looking for an actual meal, I wouldnt go there. The food is overpriced considering the quality. Or lack thereof. 4. Back to the seating, you are either sitting on park benches OR a stool. No back. I suppose this is to ensure a quick turn over for tables. Again, the focus is on getting as many heads in as possible and not the quality of the food or the experience. 5. They only have ONE menu (it was breakfast/brunch for us even at 2pm) per day and half the items on the menu arent available! =/ All in all, great place to go if you are JUST looking to go to a bar and stand around (standing would be more comfortable than their seating arrangements.

It's funny...like one of the Mexican Chinese restaurants in the Bronx but with Sushi. Since I was in the mood for sushi I ordered a roll and a few pieces of sashimi. The roll was good. The roll I ordered was called the Spice Girl Roll. The sashimi...well...I stopped eating it. You know with sushi it's all about the texture and the texture was not good. The cool thing is that they had music which was a nice added touch. Of course it was good because my boyfriend was playing but you knew I was going to say that anyway So is this a place to come back to? I would say yes. Priced well and the food was good. The sashimi I would stay away from.

I say nearly only because I'm not a fan of ginger. But that's a me thing. Getting a reservation at a reasonable time was tough, so I accepted seats at the bar. Honestly, I think that was such a fortunate problem. Got to talk to the bartender and servers a lot more about the courses and peruse the wine list with informed help. It helped to sit next to each other, as well. Made the whole thing a lot more of a social experience. Would definitely, definitely go again. This time, I'd actually be able to find it on the first try.

128450,85857,1172,2.0,1,2015-01-01,"Oh Battersby, if only I hadn't waited so long to write a review of you this would've easily been 4-5 stars. I don't know if something has changed in the kitchen or it's just the benign neglect of the original co-owners/chefs (who now spend their time in the kitchen of Dover instead), but you just aren't what you used to be, and haven't been for many months now. I used to work in the neighborhood, and have been visiting Battersby occasionally since a few months after it opened. Battersby received a lot of hype in 2012--and rightfully so--which led to the inevitable expansion from a cramped, 25+ seat hole-in-the-wall with a kitchen smaller than the one in your apartment to the roomier Dover, where you will not be forced to sit on your neighbor's folded-up parka as you might on occasion at Battersby. Unfortunately this success is no longer represented in the food. Battersby is still ambitious; it's probably the only restaurant in the neighborhood that relies on a (spontaneous) tasting menu more so than a la carte items (other than Take Root, but those ladies are playing an entirely different game). But such ambition is failed by a wine menu that can most generously be described as lacking. And service is still a little hit or miss, which is not what you want to deal with for five or more courses. We have been met by both a warm, attentive server (who was on the newer side), an agreeable bartender with questionable choice in accessories, and a disinterested, borderline dismissive host. I don't mind the tasting-only reservation policy, as I would imagine it has to do more with table turnover than anything else (a seven-course tasting menu is going to take roughly two-three hours to get through, versus a la carte dining, which can be done in much less time). Now that the hype has died down, the wait for dinner most nights isn't nearly what is used to be anyway. But the kitchen seems to be riding the coattails of praise earned by others. Entrees still hit you with a sort of winter heaviness, but lack any dash of acidity to cut through richness. There can also, at times, be a lack of textural complexity that turns solid flavors into baby food in my mouth. I really do want greatness for Battersby, but more often than not I am faced with a prawn salad swimming in too much dressing, underseasoned gnocchi or burrata that seems derivative. While occasionally presented with a perfectly cooked hamachi or wonderfully cooked sweetbreads, the misses outnumber the hits these days. (And the dessert is typically an afterthought. The take-home treats they give you to end each meal will make you happier than some bland chocolate cold thing, so let the rosemary focaccia take up that space in your stomach instead.) I don't want to give Battersby 2.5 stars, but you were once one of the Ten Best New Restaurants in the country, and now you're just another Smith Street joint.

This is not a sit down place, it's a take out. Despite the long lines, the chef really works through it quickly. He also gives you a generous portion. The bad news is this is a cash only place, so make sure you withdraw some from an ATM before you visit. The good news, you don't even have to withdraw a lot. Seriously...like less than $5 for a small container (last time I checked) and $5.50 for the large container. I highly recommend trying the roast pork with rice before you try their chicken or duck. You can't really go wrong with any of them (I just have a preference for the pork). I would go as far as saying this is the Chinese version of ""comfort food"" because of how good it taste and how simple it is (Rice, Pork, and Cabbage). This is probably the best roast pork I've had, and I tried from many Chinese places from Chinatown to Flushing. Writing about this makes me want to drop by and order one to go to satisfy my craving.

There was a huge sign on the door stating NO COUPONS, NO 1/2 PRICE SUSHI, NO SPECIALS! OK, it's New Years Eve, so understandable, but you didn't have to scream it... We got led to our table around the hibachi grill and the waitress came and took our order. Then the chef came out and promptly said there would be no fire at the table because there were children there. WTF? So he proceeded with the most boring presentation I ever saw at a Hibachi grill. No fire, no catching shrimp in the hat, no spinning eggs, no saki...just this boring Japanese guy...cooking. And not well... The rare steak was overdone, the chicken was underdone, and the portions were so ridiculously small we left hungry. On top of that, they overcharged us by charging my wife for chicken and steak and only giving her chicken and shrimp...which everyone got! That was the last time I'll go there New Years Eve, or quite frankly...EVER!

Second attemp: I went to Wahoo at 1:15pm on a Friday on a different cold winter day. The ordering and food service experience was EXTREMELY fast, efficient, and friendly. We were off to a great start! It wasn't too crowded, but we ended up at a table near the door and it was cold for me. Head to the back half of the place to stay warm. The place was covered in skate boards, long boards, snowboards, and there was a giant sneaker over my head. slightly gimmicky, but could be good for conversation. The Wahoo chicken salad - charbroiled - sounded great. I had it without cheese or tortilla strips. The person I ordered from highly recommended the roasted pepper cilantro dressing, so I had it. My friends had the guac, salsa and chips and to me the guac looked dry. I wouldn't get that salad again. My one friend had the Carnitas salad we both noticed that the salads seemed wet. Her dressing came on the side, which she didn't request, and mine was on the food. The wetness to me didn't seem to come from too much dressing, but rather just the ingredients being... wet. Perhaps the salsa wasn't strained enough or something like that. It still tasted good- just was soggy. My other friend had fish tacos, rice and black beans - she said she was satisfied, so that's good. We all agreed we would go back to check out happy hour, but if we went back would try other foods. I believe that there is something to this place, and maybe it can be found in the golden hour of sweet, sweet drink deals.

Maybe it's because it's Aussie owned (I've heard great things about the cafes down under), with menu items like avo-toast and flat-whites. The overall airy, bright decor is refreshing to the rustic, dark feel that most cafes in New York have. Modern art, hanging bulb lights, wooden tables, and acai bowls make it look like it's straight from your Instagram feed. But the REAL reason for 4 stars? Probably the bomb almond-milk latte, made decadently with perfect latte art. Arguably the best latte I've had in a long time. The space is utilized well in terms of seats, but it does tend to get crowded. However, I've been able to snag a table easily both times I've been. Unfortunately, there's no free Wi-Fi, but nonetheless a great place to catch up with a friend.

The avo toast is delicious- the bread pulls apart easily and is some sort of multi-grain or wheat mix. We chose to top ours with a fried egg (#yolkporn) and they did the honors of dusting the dish with red pepper chili flakes. Win all around. The seating is a bit hunger games-esque because there isn't a lot of it, but this spot is hot. However, as they are moving to tableside and seating service, this issue should be worked out nicely.

To spice things up a lil we tried the tuna dumplings, which for us were a new addition to the menu. It's fun to watch the sushi chef Jim skillfully make the dumplings. I was pleasantly surprised to find them filled with mashed avocado - not what I was expecting. They were good. At $10 for two dumplings, however, it's  slightly overpriced. That's my only complaint of the night. The other rolls - Sansom Roll and Crazy Roll, were just how we remembered. Delicious. We chatted with Jim, who was our sushi chef two years ago, too. He is soft spoken but very sweet. While we ate we watched many regular customers stop by for take out, and Jim clearly knew them all, which was cute. Thanks Jim and Vic Sushi, for another 10/10 meal!

We followed with our first course, where we had a mushroom bread, ricotta with cranberry compote, a particular favorite of mine, a fluke crudo with dill, tuna sashimi, and a special pizza if the night, dates and prosciutto. After our first course, we relaxed for a few enjoyed another drink or two and moved on. Our entree was amazing. We had the red snapper, the fried chicken which was hands down the most moist and flavorful fried chicken i've ever tasted, the mushroom pizza with egg, and the lobster special with truffle butter glaze.   To finish the meal off, we had the ice cream sundae, which is designed to be a deconstructed snickers bar with salted caramel ice cream, chocolate sauce, peanuts, and caramel popcorn. In addition, our waiter sent out a piece of chocolate cheesecake. Usually, one or two items stands out as a defining dish of a meal. On the flip side, one or two items stands out as being slightly less or even not worth ordering. However, after enjoying the meal we had, I can honestly say, everything was top notch. Every dish was perfectly balanced and I found myself sad when the meal was over. Our waiter was another particular stand out. He was intelligent, informed, helpful, mindful of us and funny.

My friend and I came in around 1:30pm on Saturday, waited about 30 minutes and got seated. We didn't get our water until 20 minutes in, finally having to ask the waitress for it. No one came by to ask how things were--okay whatever, it's Saturday brunch in NYC. It's busy, we get it. But you can clearly see the servers just chilling on the side together, sipping on coffee, chit-chatting. It was pretty hard to get their attention. We got our food on a decent pace (thank yous to the kitchen!) and almost took 10 minutes to get a server by us to ask for the check. After paying, one of the girls came by and asked if everything was okay and how service was. We told her honestly saying that it was pretty slow. She responded saying that it IS Saturday and brunch time. My friend mentioned some of the servers talking, standing, drinking coffee on the side. She says ""okay"" and walks away. When she came back to drop off our change, she states ""why don't you guys try being on your feet for 9 hours"" in the nastiest and rudest tone of voice ever. The more ironic thing is I'm a server myself and the friend I came with is a cook at a very fast-paced restaurant. Food was nothing more than mediocre.

Definitely not worth a second visit especially with the service from hell.

My shrimp with lobster sauce was warm/cool and had a tennis ball size slab of egg white hidden within the lobster sauce. YUK! Pepper steak was rubbery and one bowl of rice for 6 people. Really?  Ok now for the service.  Seated quickly with reservations, great.  So we are reading our menus and our halogen light goes out.  Waiter said he thought they had fixed it before we came in. So the only way to read the menu is with our phones.  They bring additional candles and the manager comes over and says we may have to wait a while for a new table and could not guarantee a table change would happen right away.  What?  How about  - we will move you ASAP.?  or We are going to let your kids eat free? I could not even see what was in the egg rolls.

I sat in the corner near the door and shared the attractive floor with three other occupied tables.  It was a cold and quiet night.  My server took a few minutes to find me, but she was courteous, efficient and prompt.  The Side Salad came out first.  It was small with a nice Spring Mix, if a bit light on the house Italian dressing.  Just greens. No cheese, nuts, dried fruit. Basic salad. The two small dinner rolls were housemade and quite good with a crunchy crust and mildly salty flavor.   The wide brimmed white bowl of pasta was adequate, if not generous.  The spinach was cut into smaller pieces and fully sautéed into the oil and garlic.  Tasty.  The pool of oil at the bottom of the bowl was perhaps more than expected, but it did not detract from the al dente Rigatones that were bathing in it.  The garlic taste was strong although not a lot of the bulb was showing in the dish.   The meal was competent and filling, if not memorable.  There was a lack of energy emanating from the food. It did not visibly shine as many good meals do. Maybe it was the cold night, or the sparse occupancy, but the experience was flat.  Given the cost of this simple meal ($17), I guess I anticipated something more dynamic. That I could not get an internet signal in the house compounded this impression.

The pancetta could have been fried a bit more though. The arugula and plum tomatoes added some freshness and acidity to each bite, though the chili spread wasn't apparent at all. Breakfast Burrito [$8.50] Scrambled eggs, roasted peppers, mushrooms, sweet onions, jack cheese, flour tortilla, homemade hot sauce, sour cream I was looking for something heartier so went with the breakfast burrito.

A full order supposedly comes with honey and whipped cream. While it was a bit dense and not as fluffy as I would've expected from a ricotta pancake, the bits of strawberry helped to make a decent bite. FYI - it's 50 cents more than advertised online.

Nice crunch on the outside with a creamy filling. I really wanted to order a extra helping via a side dish, but stopped myself, only because I wanted to save room for dessert. My companion had the large angry shrimp taco. She got lots of Shrimp and the accompanying sauces (avocado purée and chipotle aioli) were like buttah! We moved on to the Frozen S'mores Napoelon for Two which consists of a graham cracker cake and  chocolate semifreddo which is amazing. The coffee marshmallow is amazingly smoky and you get a side of the best saltiest, velvety caramel dipping sauce. It's a must order.  For those who are fans of David Burke's Cheesecake Lollipop Tree that is available at this location as well.

However our entrees left us wanting more... flavors? texture? Not sure but something was definitely missing for both entrees... We had reservation so there was no wait time and our server was very attentive. She explained the menu and took time to go over how certain dishes were made. TIP: left hand side of menu = appetizers  & right hand side are entrees Appetizers: Angry Octopus Tacos, candied bacon, & Panna avocado cotta - all were very good. Would have liked the angry tacos to be ""angrier""! If you're not a fan of octopus, go for the shrimp. Candied bacons were so tasty - thick cut bacon roasted in a syrupy glaze... mmm...  I wasn't a huge fan of the avocado dip, bc I like my avocado in chunks NOT baby-food puree! But the girls loved it. Desserts: we shared the gimmicky ""Burke-n-bag"" - chocolate hazelnut purse w wafer cookie bottom; and the seasonal ""candy cane mint donut"". Both were mouth watering goodness! OK - entrees... this was a 'miss' for us.. we shared the Bronx Filet w bone marrow... your server will cut & plate it for you,  the marrow wasn't as cooked as we would've like... as it DID NOT spread like butter... (had bone marrow at other steakhouses and it does melt in your mouth!). We also asked how the chef would recommend the steak cooked, med-rare. Turns out it was A-LOT redder than we wanted.. the texture of the meat was on the chewy side and it lacked flavor... although the rosemary fragrance was a nice touch but did not add value.   We also had the grilled whole branzino - a white flakey fish which they de-boned for you. This one is a total skip... dried, lackluster in taste and the pineapple marmalade was useless... We got a side of potato & cheese fritters - it tasted like bread. Thought it would be softer, so not needed. Overall,  a good experience with mediocre entrees.  Not sure if I'd like to give it another go... with a price tag of $380 total bill... it's a toss up.

The executive chef came out to inform us they ran out of the shrimp but offered to sub in lobster! We definitely did not mind that! The octopus was wonderfully seasoned. Main course: Squash and mushroom pappardelle-- superb! The perfect combination of sweetness from the squash and earthiness from the mushrooms created a wonderful winter dish. Pork shoulder Bolognese in a tin can-- to die for! Large portion -- I couldn't finish it and was so sad about it. Cute presentation Skirt steak-- cooked perfectly. Chorizo was amazing Dessert: The big apple tart- beautiful presentation and absolutely delicious. The caramel sauce and Mexican cinnamon ice cream were amazing. Cheesecake lollipop tree- one of their signature desserts and understandably so.  Each cheesecake flavor (cherry cashmere, triple chocolate, and toffee crunch) was better than the next and it came with an adorable dipping sauce of bubblegum whipped cream. I took the leftovers home! Decor: Very chic. I loved how the menus were fabric swatches -- very clever Service: Absolutely wonderful!

145614,98872,1340,4.0,1,2015-01-06,"First of all, 'Thank you' to the many yelpers whose reviews helped me choose this place for dinner the other night. We had a good experience and would never have found this place without you all. EXTENSIVE SAKE MENU: I didn't even know where to begin. Our server was extremely helpful in helping us choose based on what flavors and textures we like. She was also more than happy to heat up any of the sakes for us, and didn't make us feel awkward about it, which was awesome. She picked out something for him and I got something from the back of the sake menu in the ""fruity"" section. I wanted the yuzu something because it's citrusy but it was sold out (!); I got one of the plum-based sakes instead. Note: when they say ""sweet"", they're not kidding. FOOD: Essentially, this is a tapas bar with Japanese food. They have hot and cold dishes, noodles , rice, soup... Lots to choose from. WHAT HE GOT: Tuna tartare which comes topped with caviar. Ebi Shinjo (fried shrimp balls in sliced almonds). He said these were both good. I don't eat seafood so I don't care. :p But then they brought him out something REALLY FUN. (probably it was the saikoro steak but I'm not sure.) They put a platter with beef slices and a VERY HOTTTTTT STONE and a cube of lard (?) on the table. They then showed him how to COOK the slices himself on the stone to his own specifications. This was HILARIOUS - there was so much sizzle and steam happening, it felt like we were in the kitchen. Our neighbors looked really envious and I could tell they wished they had ordered this too. WHAT I GOT: TORI TSUKUNE:  (chicken meatballs in teriyaki sauce.) LOVED THIS SOOOO MUCH. KAMO ROAST: (chilled roasted duck with basil): this was okay but I didn't love this like I loved the meatballs.  It's also a cold dish and I should have ordered all hot dishes. JAGA DANGO: Potatoes in fried dough. These are tasty  but they were a little sweeter than I expected. More dough than potato. Not as potato croquette-ish as I expected. I got one order, and they brought me four of these on a plate. They are big. Next time, I will skip the duck and get more meatballs, and probably the Tori Kaarage (fried chicken in ginger and soy sauce) and some noodles! :) For DESSERT: He really enjoyed his sesame creme brulee that comes with sesame ice cream. (I was jealous.) I got the pear millefeuille which was pear slices between candied shells. There was an egg size scoop of ice cream. I was pretty bored and disappointed with my dessert, I'm afraid. I'll definitely get the creme brulee next time. Our server was very pleasant. Reception, however, could be better. Things seemed a bit unorganized and the gentleman upfront was not as welcoming as he could have been...but they probably have a million things going through their heads because of all the walk-ins, and the restaurant being full. I did see similar comments from some other yelpers, though, so maybe coming during the dinner rush just is...what it is. There was nice e atmosphere in the dining room, everyone was laughing and having a good time. I saw some people on dates, a lot of guys who seemed to be having dinner together after work, and one family with teenagers. Every diner was dressed CASUALLY.  I would do 3.75 stars if I could for the food, but 4+ for the overall experience. TIP to all: Make reservations if you can. Based on what I saw for a weeknight dinner, walk-ins can expect a bit of a wait. EVEN BETTER TIP: Read through all the reviews because there is a lot of great information that will help you navigate the menu (and the building)!

I came here with a couple friends for dinner and we ordered their infamous gnocchi and a lobster risotto special as starters. Both were delicious and beautifully presented. I've never been a huge fan of gnocchi, but this place does it well. I had the salmon as my main course and the fish was fresh and grilled lightly to greatness. The sauce, mushrooms and butternut squash complimented the dish beautifully. I really can't say much more but how great the food is- you would just have to try it for yourself. However, I can speak on behalf of the waitress that attended to our table and she was PERFECT. Of course many NYC restaurants nowadays provide you with a refillable water bottle on the table but only ONCE did I have to pick up the bottle and fill it for myself. The waitress still attended our drinks and met all our expectations. I can't wait to introduce this place to friends and family in the future.

The prix fixe menu had some appetizing options for a very decent price. I enjoyed their fried oysters and toasted gnocchi for starters, the braised short rib as an entree and an espresso with my chocolate cake. The appetizers were decadent, rich and raised the bar for the entree. The oysters were light and crispy, and my only gripe with it was that the grilled sour dough ficelle could of been a little crisper to support the remoulade and toppings. Not much can be said about the ricotta gnocchi except that it's practically a signature item and shouldn't be passed off unless you're allergic to dairy. The short rib was perfectly seasoned and tender but the farro beneath it was more than a touch too salty. The chocolate mousse cake was beautifully presented and equally delicious. It was perhaps the best executed part of the meal. Espresso was sooty and left much to be desired. I also will not comment on the mishaps in service, but at the very least, our waters were filled.

Luckily (or unluckily...), I found a more convenient place to satisfy my cravings...and the food is even better! The Omu Soba is probably my biggest guilty pleasure in the NYC dining scene. A mound of yakisoba doused in sauce with pieces of pork belly, all wonderfully wrapped in a thin omelette and dressed with Kewpie - some of my darkest epicurean dreams on a plate. I also consistently order the fried pork ribs, ebi mayo (shrimp with spicy mayo), kakuni (simmered pork belly), and tofu with miso paste. I have also found some good stuff on their daily specials. Don't worry, they do also have healthier options like their hot pots and sashimi tataki. This is my go-to place for a lazy dinner that is no less satisfying. It's a fantastic addition to the KTown neighborhood, especially if you just don't want Korean food. Come early or later as there is sometimes a wait around 7/8pm. Don't forget to order a pitcher of Sapporo to wash things down - only $15!

However, in our case, the wait *was* unacceptable. I understand they don't want to work with reservations since they probably are in no need of managing a reservation system in order to fill the restaurant every night. But, the system they have is not ok. When you walk in the waiter in charge will give you a best-case estimate that, at least in the day of our visit, was completely unreasonable. He told us we would need to wait ""at least 20 minutes"". Yes, he does stress the *at least* part. But, we were not expecting to wait for 1 hour and 15 minutes for a table of 4. I am not saying the wait is crazy, simply that if we had known we would have to stand in a crowded lobby for over an hour we would have probably gone somewhere else. Just to highlight how inefficient their system is, I saw people coming to the desk a second time to ask about their table and getting time estimates that were higher than before: ""What? You are telling me now I have to wait *at least* 30 minutes when 30 minutes ago you told me 20 minutes?"" I guess it can be even funny, if you come prepared for it.

At first glance, the sandwich looks unassuming.  But as soon as you bite into it, your life changes.  I know this also because my boyfriend was watching me take the first bite and he wondered why I never look at him the same way.  He's just no competition to this biscuit. Everything about it is perfect.  The flavorful cheddar biscuit (I love biscuits in general, but this took it to the next level), the perfectly fried egg (not too runny, not overcooked), the ham (honestly, this was probably the least memorable ingredient) and most importantly whatever crack they put in that jalapeno jam.  Not caring that my boyfriend was watching this affair unfold before his eyes, I lustfully seduced the biscuit... ""I'll be jalapeno jam ANY day!"" To top this off, my chai latte was BANGING. Most chai lattes are more or less the same.  But this was one was silky smooth, not grainy, perfectly warm and not too hot with just the right amount of foam.  Also for some reason, it is all white (not that I have preference over color, but a white chai latte is something I consider exotic and hey! I like to try new things). The collard greens and the gingerade were equally as good.  My boyfriend had the Richmond, but honestly, we can't tell if it is even good or not because it was utterly out-shined by the biscuit sandwich.

But there's always something holding me back from putting it into my regular Bushwick rotation. As many have mentioned before, the cash-only thing is a big drawback for me. This isn't some dive bar with $3 beers or sketchy chinese take-out joint where no one speaks English; you're charging double digits for cocktails and offering food and can't be bothered to accept credit cards? Hell, I would rather even download some stupid mobile payment app than have to go pay some rip-off in-house ATM surcharge if you are really going to tell me that the credit card processing fee is such a big deal. Cash-only always feels like an aggressive ""eff you"" to the customer. (Sidenote: I once dated someone who sold/leased ATMs on the side in high school in the city. Apparently it doesn't take long for those babies to pay for themselves.) But even if I can remember to bring along a few stripper bucks, The Narrows still manages to fail its potential. On the few occasions I was there over the summer/early fall and there was space in the back patio available, I still didn't want to sit out there because there was always some group chainsmoking their hearts out. (I'm not full-on anti-smoking--if that's your thing, so be it--but I definitely don't want to smell like it for the rest of the night.) And service has always been hit-or-miss when we don't sit in the main room. There's supposed to be waitress service everywhere, but I could've written the sequel to Nathaniel P. in the time it took the waitress to come back to us on the most recent attempt. (Homeboy eventually just gave up and helped himself at the bar, leaving me to stare at my phone solo and eat the string cheese I randomly found in my bag.) In the end, I'm not going to object to The Narrows if someone else suggests it; I do enjoy myself a $6 beer + (not horrible) tequila special. But I'm not going to go out of my way to go back there, either.

150669,15355,1038,3.0,1,2015-01-06,"Dear Yelp Friend, You are probably the only ones who will see this review.  Since we are friends, my review appears at the top of your page, but for all of those who are not my friend, my review of GIotto will be lost among the 236 other reviews of this restaurant, that miraculously average out to 4.5 stars.  Really, I just don't see it. If you don't feel like reading the whole review, here's a summary: The food is over-rated, and the restaurant is cramped and not worth the wait.   Anyway, I had tried to go to Giotto 3 times over the course of a few years, and never had a meal there.  EIther they were closed, or the wait was absurd, or they didn't have any decent reservations available.  Finally, on my fourth try, I got into the almighty Osteria Giotto, and had dinner. I called the day before and made a reservation for 8:30.  I had really wanted closer to 7:00pm, but there was no availability.  I specifically asked when I called, ""Is it a real 8:30?""  ""Yes,"" he responded, ""it is a real 8:30pm."" So, I arrived with my date at 8:35pm on that Thursday, having called to let them know I would be a few minutes late, and stood in a cramped foyer being bumped twice every three minutes, until 9:14 pm.  I know it was 9:14 pm because I was staring at my watch waiting to leave and drop one star on this place when the clock struck 9:15 pm.   I don't consider myself to be a big whiner, but really, I wanted to sit down to dinner at 7:00.  I would accept 8:30.  But 9:15??  For a week night, that's just too late for me.  I was really annoyed that they stole my 45 minutes, and when I got home, I had to get right to bed, and didn't have any time to wind down. The food was okay, but then, I've never really had a bad Osso Buco.  They served it with spinach mashed potatoes.  I didn't think the spinach was necessary, and I had requested a creamy polenta substitute (which is extremely easy to make).  The server told he would try to get it, and never got back to me about that.  I had started with a seafood salad which was actually pretty good, but needed more acid.  I don't really remember the rest, but from the looks of things, this is pretty normal Italian food.  Certainly no better than what I would make at home.  Looking around the restaurant I didn't see anything that was innovative or impressive.   Finally, the server seemed sincere and comped a us a panna cotta for having such a long wait.  I would have preferred to have been seated on time - my time is worth more than a $8.00 dessert.  I'll try them one more time since so many of you rave about, but if I have to wait more than 10 minutes, I'll let you know on Yelp.   Happy New Year.

I completely understand the philosophical reasons of not wanting to consume something that has the texture of meat. The vegan dog did not eat like a real hot dog. But, I do feel like they were trying to create a vegan version of the ""snap"" a hot dog has when you bite through the casing. In this case, the vegan dog had an almost elastic texture where it tugged back when you bit in. This was kind of cool and I assume intentional but it also kind of came across as rubbery. The ketchup, mustard and relish on top were good but I kind of felt like they were there to intentionally cover up the taste of the dog which really wasn't bad (and I've had some BAD vegan hot dogs before). The bun I will say was really really good. The kale chips were delicious but watch out, your first bowl is free, if you get a craving more it costs $3!

The food - everything I have ever eaten here is very good to excellent.  The ribs are quite good, the wings fantastic, the burgers juicy and large enough to satisfy.  The highlights for me though are the Mahi Mahi tacos (expensive but worth it) and the Chorizo burger (freakin' unbelievable).  If this is your first time here I recommend the slider trio - nice way to sample a little bit of what they have to offer.  Sides are also reliably good - the crab potato corn hash is so differently awesome, and the red mashed potatoes will lead you to carb coma. Drinks - great selection of both local and national micro-craft beers, both on tap and bottled (though stick with the draft - and get a flight because you will want to try them all).  Their unique cocktail list is decent, if a bit leaning towards the sweet side.   Prices are, considering the area, fair.  The crowd is usually cool, with the occasional lost tourist or douche local thrown in for entertainment.  Service can be on the efficient-yet-aloof side, and while children are welcome I would leave them home.  As mentioned, wait for a window or sidewalk table - it's one of the better people watching spots in the area.

When we asked to be reseated further from the window the hostess told us those tables needed to be reserved for other guests. The table was slanted because of the melt plate and my left side was freezing the entire time. We were left waiting for our beverages after we ordered them and another staff member ended up asking if we had been served and we had to tell him we were waiting on our drinks. The meal took much longer to prepare and serve than I it normally does. I will keep coming back, but a word with your service staff is in order.

The breakfast potatoes were crispy and well seasoned and the filo cup made for such a beautiful plate I almost didn't want to eat it!

He had his heart set on the angus burger.  Once we sat down and looked over the physical menu, we realized the angus burger was not listed. The one they did list was a typical burger but priced $1.50 more.  He ordered the burger anyways and was so disappointed decided to stop eating all together.  The waitress did offer to replace it, which he refused, but the burger was still on our bill even though he ate only a quarter of it.  After talking it over on our car ride home, I decided to call the store and talk to a manager.  I called the restaurant and after being left on hold for 5 minutes, was greeted by a very unapologetic owner.  He barely even let me speak and talked over me the entire conversation.  With so many amazing places to eat in New Haven, there isn't any reason to settle for for one that isn't friendly.  In conclusion, avoid the burger and don't expect the owner to care if you are left unsatisfied by your experience!

Other than the pastry pinwheel which we split for dessert, my friend and I ordered three meals and split them so that we could feel as if we'd tried lots of dishes and could make a well informed call on whether we liked the food or not. The wafflini was my favorite by far.  I didn't expect such subtle flavors.  Nor did I expect the flavors to blend so perfectly.  We ordered the half portion of the proscuitto, gouda and honey. I was a little worried it would be too sweet (I can't eat much sugar) but it was perfect.  The next time I go I will order a whole portion and refuse to share it with anyone! We also ordered the popover stuffed with egg, cheese and sausage.  I really enjoyed this.  The popover was not overcooked (a complaint I have about Mirabelle's popovers) and the stuffing was truly tasty.  The eggs were moist and seasoned perfectly.  The other fillings did not disappoint. My friend ordered the polenta with scallions. I'm not much into oniony flavors so I only had a small bite of this.  I think I would have loved it without the scallions.  We also ordered more scrambled eggs, a corn muffin and some sausage.  These things were all good though not as great as the carefully thought out wafflini and popover dishes. I'm eager to go back and try out more dishes.  Brunch/breakfast is my favorite meal and it's a pleasure to go some place that is different from the rest and holds a few surprises.  It's also nice to eat food that has been carefully planned (flavors, textures, etc) by someone who knows what they are doing.  The chef definitely inherited some serious cooking skills from his mom ;)

Then there's the back garden, which is covered and heated with some heating lamps. In December, this makes it a cold and rather uncomfortable seating area.

Great draught beer selection with a nice mix of local VT brews and others from outside the state, The bottle list was not great though, and it irks me when I see Bud and Bud Light served at a nice restaurant in VT. I wouldn't recommend going here for mixed drinks. My wife had one that tasted like burning rubber (confirmed by everyone I was with), and someone else got the ""Martinez"" and it was so sweet she had to dilute it with ice water. There are already plenty of places in Burlington for great mixed drinks, so this isn't a deal breaker for me. Everyone in our group thought the food was excellent. Great taste and solid portions. I started with the ""Sausage + Pretzel"" and had the ""Waterworks Steak Frites"" for my main dish. Everything was A+. Earlier this year I had a $42 steak from Hen of the Wood in Burlington, and the steak from Waterworks was 10x better and half the price. The fries were a little soggy, but I had a good buzz at that point from drinking good beer that it didn't really matter. This is the restaurant I was hoping Hen of the Wood would be and am jealous that Burlington doesn't have a place like this.

There are so many ""real"" Italian delis in New Jersey that are much better than this place. Sorry for being so negative and condescending. But it's so frustrating to to get excited about another Italian deli opening only to be disappointed once again. I grew up with true salumerias in Bay Ridge Brooklyn where the stores were surrounded by Italian immigrants and places where you wouldn't last if you served mediocrity or were very expensive. Unfortunately I have to visit places like A&G in Warren, A&S in Nutley, Piccola Gastronomia in Ridgefield or even ALC in Brooklyn to get my true Italian food and products at great prices. This place won't make it and I won't be back. On a positive note, I did hear there is another new small market/caterer in East Hanover that will have cheeses, salume and high end prepared foods opening soon. I have hope and once again I hope I won't be disappointed.

Then later the server took much too long to drop out check.  Granted they were busy but let us pay so you can turn the table. On the second visit the server gave us water and then disappears for 10 minutes while we sit and wait. Again food is fantastic and maybe we just got 2 poor servers.  The other servers seemed like they were on top of things.

I would have liked  the pastrami to have been more prominent. By the end I was covered in poppy seeds and egg yolk and was pretty satisfied. We weren't stuffed, so we got dessert; affogato: goat cheese ice cream with hot espresso poured over it, served with walnut cookies. Perfect way to end brunch. Beware! This Yelp page is deceiving.

It's basically two slices in one, which makes the $4.50 seem much more reasonable.  The first bite into that creamy sauce was delicious. The crust is super crispy how I love. The problem is, with each bite that followed the sauce tasted like heavy béchamel sauce with nothing special about it.  If I was drunk and eating this at 3 am I may have had a different impression but after four bites I just ripped off the crust, ate that and called it a day. Too sickening to enjoy. I returned once more and got the margarita slice which was delicious! Would return for it. Only issue is that crust is my fav part and this crust was so burnt to a crisp that it was impossible to even bite into. Overall Not worth the hype, but you can def enjoy a slice from this spot.  Just don't wait on a long line for it.

Ended up ordering an artichoke pizza pie (whole pizza). Took 25-30 minutes to make. The place is pretty small and only has standing room. There are a couple of benches outside too but not ideal in this weather. There is a restaurant version next door if you're looking for a seat. When we got the pizza, it came straight out of the oven. The artichoke cheese was so melted it slid off the side of the pizza over my hand into my mouth. The artichoke pizza tasted just like artichoke dip. It was strangely satisfying. Right out of the oven, the crust was nice and soft and tasted like premium free bread you get at fancy Italian restaurants. This was by far the messiest pizza I have ever eaten but it somehow fulfilled my primitive urge as the cheese slathered all over my hands/face and clothes as it took gobs of this pizza and shoved it into my mouth. Summary: Pizza was really good but not life changing. Artichoke pizza tastes like artichoke dip on really really good crust. Standing room only.

It was the color of butternut squash soup so I was secretly hoping it'll be that, but nope.

Unfortunately the host was incredibly rude to us when we entered the restaurant, showing no common courtesy and then even making a flat-out condescending and very rude remark when we inquired about seating somewhere else. We were very close to getting up and leaving because it was such a horrible first impression. It was rainy and we were hungry so we ended up staying, and I am glad we did, as we were able to see that the food, ambiance and most of the staff were all an extremely positive experience. But wow - there's nothing better than entering a restaurant and being treated like crap from a host! Will go back for sure, but management should be aware.

I ordered the pulled pork and it was surprisingly really good!  Don't expect it to knock your socks off, but it was still tasty enough to make my eyes grow bigger after my first bite.  As for my drink of the night, I had the Lavender Monk, which was sweet and strong - just the way I like it.  As previous reviewers mentioned, the interior is romantic with soundless old movies projected on a brick wall.  Service was great, as well.  I know there are a million restaurants to try in Manhattan, but BEA is a restaurant that doesn't sacrifice the quality of food while providing an intimate atmosphere and THAT, my friends, is rare.

It's all hipsters now) So we're driving in Bushwick at night in this industrial looking neighborhood. I see a bar among the gray buildings. This is it! This is it? A bar. You're taking us to a bar that has cajun food? Yup. It's Brooklyn! Sure enough, we walk through a bar (Hipsters everywhere) and in the back is the restaurant or dining area if you will. We sit and they are rockin' the music! I order a happy hour Left Hand Milk Stout to get the party started. Appetizers are ordered. I ordered the Fried Pork Belly. If this sounds crazy to you, its the most sane thing in the world. Its a decadent dish that's fatty and meaty. Oh, it was so good and I highly recommend this dish for the first time you come to Tchoup Shop. We all order their signature biscuits. My southern bud orders a seafood Po Boy. I ask him: Is it good? Just like home? (Repeat 20 more times) I ordered the Duck Gumbo. The Duck Gumbo is good! Spicy and flavorful, its just spot on. Here's the kicker, my entire meal was under $30 bucks. (I love you Tchoup Shop chef) We both wanted to try their shrimp and grits dish but they were out of shrimp. Out of shrimp? Go to the jerk store! (Sorry, Seinfeld joke) The waiter, total hipster. Didn't write anything down and tells me I ordered a chicken biscuit. I tell him I ordered a ""biscuit"". I should knock off a star but the food was outstanding. Think about this neighborhood.

It's another plus that it's even cheaper than other Vietnamese places we've frequented. Since we live so close to Nam Phuong, I anticipate this will be our new go-to spot...if only we came here sooner! The only down side (potentially) is that they aren't BYOB like other Vietnamese places we've been to around the Philly area, but we don't mind (really the beer here is so reasonable that I doubt buying it in a PA beer shop is that much cheaper). Plus, we love the imported Asian beers. I also got a coconut drink that was so good! The hot tea wasn't the best I've had, but hey it's free so can't complain!

Next came the entree-sized portions of the pulled pork shank sandwich, ham and cheese croquettes, and custard french toast with raspberry and ricotta with choc chips. The sandwich was my favorite bite, especially when topped with the spicy peppers that were served on the side. The croquettes were very fairly portioned and sat on top of a bowl of delicious brown gravy. The french toast was decadent and not too heavy, but were the largest portion on the table. We also had a few beers (awesome tap menu!) and a non-alcoholic Bloody Mary (for the mom-to-be). Overall, everything was solid. The only downside was the wait, but it was expected because of how busy the place was! Note: they rotate their food and drink menu daily!! It's really well crafted and balanced.

Anyway, a waiter had brought a knife assuming we shared, but once we cut into it, all the juices came splashing out...oh no! Like an amateur xiao long bao mishap. NO on the knife! We like the small dishes like the 'xue xai Mao do' that are on point with price. If it wasn't for the Cash Only requirement, we'd come here more often or I'd have to hit the ATM every time!

Our group ordered the blackened catfish, creole wings, pulled pork sandwich, burger, jambalaya, and holiday ham.  Most of us liked the creole wings; they were piping hot and full of flavor, and a little on the spicy side.  The entrees were full of flavor, the catfish was perfect and moist.  The burger was huge and most people probably would not be able to bite into it in one shot.   No complaints here, amazing food and atmosphere!

For my birthday I chose to make a reservation at piquant but of course my number changed and they tried to tell me I have to pay for the missing people.  OK no, next! Headed to the spot bc I love the ambiance& prices but it was CLOSED. Boo. So the 6 of us in my crew headed to peaches for brunch 1/3/15 and by this time we were famished.  They don't take ahead reservations but our wait was about 20 minutes. It was a BIG plus that the live band was playing while we waited which i didnt even know about. Loved seeing a fully chocolate restaurant of staff and patrons who were all good looking. Felt good real talk. Got seated and I ordered the shrimp & grits which were perfect. And a side of fried eggs which came with pickled onions which I am now obsessed with. I do believe the shrimp & grits or most entrees are meant to be ordered with a side bc the portion size was just right for me. Not big enough for leftovers or a grown man tho. Also ordered french toast  (I split it with a friend no judgment) which was battered with granola and came with FRESH not soggy fruit on top! I'm trying really hard to think of any french toast I ever had that was better in my 27 years of life. Can't do it. My drank doe. I ordered the 1st one on the menu, can't remember the name, it had something brownstone related in the name.  Boy do I love a tall drink! I only needed one, that Thang played no games whatsoever. Tried everyone else's food like the kale salad, sweet potatoes fries,  tilapia and it was unanimous that the food was amazing.  Lastly SERVICE.  I admit I kept bugging the hostess when we would be seated and she never caught an attitude just remained cool the entire time. Our waitress was amazing.  Extremely attentive and friendly & knowledgeable about the food. All in all I paid for one entree, a side of eggs and a drank for $37 including 19% tip.

Unfortunately, by 7:15pm our entrees had not yet arrived and we had to leave without eating dinner.   The manager came over and gave us excuses as to why the food took so long, including that they had two large tables that mistakenly got put ahead of our dinners. But he offered no apology.   We were so starved that we actually came back after the performance and ordered entrees and dessert.  The food was actually good.  Surprisingly, however, the manager offered us no compensation for our inconvenience.

These coffees are high quality, and though they offer cream and sugar, it isn't really necessary. They have small food dishes. We ordered hot cakes and egg sandwiches, which reminded my friend and I greatly of Japanese cafes when we were in Japan. We topped off the meal by sharing a great fruit parfait.

It was our first time sitting at the long lit up table in the middle and staring right at Buddha's belly. Great spot!

My margarita was probably one of the worsts of my life. Disappointing, for the price. I tried my husband's mojito and it was pretty excellent. We had a bunch of dishes, some more memorable than others. - Crispy calamari salad, which used to be my absolute favorite, seemed very salty. Maybe my tastes have changed, but I did not enjoy it as much as usual. - Peking Duck salad had very little actual duck by the time it got to me, so I cannot attest for the flavor of that dish. - Kobe beef Satay were yummy. Very nicely grilled. Tempura vegetables plentiful and crispy. - Hoisin glazed pork belly with the steamed buns I could eat all day every day. It was my first time trying this dish and I was in love from the very first bite. The marinated cabbage that accompanied the sweet and fatty pork belly was a delight. - Edamame dumplings were yum. The slight truffle flavor was not overpowering in the slightest. - Spare ribs were delicious. I would probably get that again. I was not as impressed with the char grilled aged beef however. I thought it lacked seasoning and flavor. The watercress salad mentioned on the menu was kind of non-existent. Lost underneath the humongous pile of szechuan fries. - The lamb chops were excellent! Although ours were not cooked to the temperature specified and were much more rare. - Wasabi crusted filet was not my favorite. I tried the part without the wasabi crust on it and it was completely and utterly bland. My husband loved it. - Pad Thai was good but nothing to write home about. Very typical. - Chinese eggplant WAS and IS my absolute favorite dish at Buddakan. I always order extra just so I can take home. For $9 its the cheapest thing on the menu and oh so good!!

The doorman was pleasant enough though, giving us the option of sitting outside under the heated lamps (we turned this down, since we were both very cold). We ordered the prosciutto plate as an appetizer, which had delicious bread and pickles/condiments on the side. The waitress was extremely accomodating and gave us gluten-free crackers instead of the bread, to accomodate my boyfriend. We are both wine and cheese noobs, so our waitress was extremely patient in explaining the different types of wine and asking us what we would prefer;  her recommendations were spot-on. We choose two cheeses, both of which came with a special fig sauce that complemented their tastes PERFECTLY. We had a great time talking about what exactly made certain foods go well together, as it seems like Tria has gotten it down to a science!!

We came for Sunday school and tried the entire menu (Peirano Estate Zinfandel, $5; Weyerbacher Quad, $3.50; and a Portuguese sheep cheese, $4). Now that's a steal. I'm not a fan of Zinfandel but this was divine. The wine and cheese selection overall is pretty excellent. We tried two snacks and a bruschetta: -- Truffled egg toast: the egg was perfectly cooked and placed on the soft brioche toast. I want to meet the genius who put together truffle oil and egg because seriously, seriously. -- Warm Poached Black Mission Figs with Gorgonzola and Prosciutto di Parma: ummm need I say anymore? Figs + cheese + prosciutto = GIMME MORE -- Eggplant Caponata: this was my favorite. The eggplant was incredible. Service was impeccable.

We've definitely had both hits and misses here, but for the most part, we've been happy. While I don't get hung up on the atmosphere of restaurants too much, as I like my hole-in-the-wall spots, this place is so much nicer and cleaner than most other Indian restaurants I've been to. It's definitely worth a mention. Neither my husband and I are vegetarian but we always try to order one vegetarian dish and one meat dish. So, we've had their okra, eggplant, malai kofta, dal tadka, and one paneer dish that looked very, er, unappetizing, but tasted very good. Although I did think both the paneer and dal tasted better the next day. The okra is super. The chaat appetizer that they assemble tableside is one of my favorites. It's a very generous portion and can easily serve as an app for 4 people. We were once recommended to order the chicken chops from the tandoor menu. They are outstanding -- spicy and very juicy. The regular naan is very good and kashmiri naan, which we haven't seen on very many other Indian menus, is sweetly delicious with shredded coconut, almonds, raisins and cashews. The carrot dessert, gajar halwa is also great. Most of the curries that we've tried have been good with the meat tender and never overcooked. When we ask for spicy, they almost always get it right. If the dish is not spicy enough, they've brought out a small dish of hot sauce that we can add to the dish. The chicken korma and butter chicken are great for our son who has still to develop a palate for spicy food. On the downside, we found both the ground meat kebabs and the kaati rolls to be disappointingly dry. Chicken mango was also uninspired. And the plates, the damn plates have these curved rims that make it impossible to rest your cutlery on it, so your knives and forks are constantly slipping into your food on the plate unless you rest them on the table. It is incredibly annoying. The prices do seem a little steep for the portion sizes, but we always end up taking leftovers home, or at the very least, the remains of the sauce which we reheat and eat with rice. We try to take advantage of the Yelp coupon when we remember, as well as Groupon/Living Social offers. I don't ever eat at buffets, but I've heard they have a good one that's not too pricey. So I'll have to try it out at some point.

Their menu has a vast selection to accommodate any diet (vegan/vegetarian as well). I highly recommend the veg biryani. It comes with yogurt on the side and it adds a different delicious taste to the dish. The Veg biryani is considered spicy without the yogurt. The mushroom saag is also very delicious.  At first I thought I wouldn't be able to taste the mushrooms, but I was wrong. The mushroom in this dish remained its own natural fresh taste. The spices did not take away from the mushroom. The malai kofta, there were a decent amount of dumplings in one order. The sauce is absolutely delicious. The service was good.

The place is tiny, in a cozy intimate manner, a couple of friends not a group kind of cozy. The menu (on the paper place mat) is very limiting with few lunch choices. I ordered the chopped lamb and eggplant lasagne, silly me thought when a menu mentions an ingredient, that it should be on your plate.  This item was mentioned under the pasta section and lacked lasagna, so it with safe to assume that it was an actual lasagne, but no; it was eggplant slices baked lasagne style with some chopped lamb, which wasn't even close to an appetite filler. With that kind of little portion, almost average  tasting dish, it is extremely over priced for it. That's all in my opinion and based on my experience. Did I mention that I went by myself on my birthday to treat myself? I was indeed, disappointed.

Sugar packets that read ""Sugar For My Honey"" are a nice touch, but what's really important here is the food. The green shakshuka was zesty, but not overly spicy, and the eggs were done just enough. Challah toast on the side was ideal for dunking, but if you're liberal in using the bread to soak up the saucy-yolky goodness, you may want to ask for extra toast. The poached eggs with tomato and haloumi was an equally delicious dish, but seldom can you go wrong with any of those three (especially when they're served together). If you forego a brunch cocktail (or, really, even if you don't), the Nana Tea is well worth ordering. A tall clear glass is loaded with so much fresh mint that the scent reaches across the table. It'll warm you up and wake you up - a necessity of brunch.

He's Jewish, and despite growing up on the Main Line, having parents who love eating/Jewish cuisine, and everyone else he knows having dined at Zahav, he had not. But I wanted something super special, and thankfully as luck would have it, the day after tickets went on sale for the August Chef's Counter, I scored seats for us. I was so excited I'm sure I told everyone I knew. 7pm each Wednesday they set up the 4 seats for the tasting menu. Typically created by Mike Solomonov himself, we were informed upon arrival that sadly The Chef was in NYC for a private fundraiser. However, we had his right-hand man for the chef's counter at the helm, and their sommelier Brian informed us that we'd be dining with two Zahav co-workers - one of whom was leaving, so the entire kitchen was amped to give her an experience to remember and we'd get to benefit as well! I made my husband do the drinks paring as well. YOU MUST DO IT TOO. Food and drinks are well spread out over what will be a 5 hour meal, although I definitely got drunk in the best way possible relatively quickly. I'll try to be succinct, but since they were nice enough to give me a printout of the courses, including drinks, I must name them all: Chicken Wings with Watermelon Harissa, Amba, and House Pickles paired with Two Brothers Domaine DuPage. Freaking delicious, but no surprise from the kitchen that then created Federal Donut's. The French country ale paired perfectly, very drinkable. Hummus Tehina with Baharat Chicken Liver, Caramelized Onion, and paired with Baharat Rum Sidecar. BEST HUMMUS AND PITA EVER. But if you've been to Dizengoff, you know that. I wouldn't think alcohol with hummus, but NOW I DO! Grilled Fairytale Eggplant with Sumac Lebne, Pistachio, Mint, paired with Israeli Salad Martini. Thank you, Mike, for creating the BEST eggplant my husband has ever eaten, thereby ruining any chances I have of cooking it (""Is it the fairytale eggplant we had at Zahav? No? That's alright, then."" GRRRR). Also, the martini tasted EXACTLY like an Israeli salad and YES it was scrumptious. Naya Tabbouleh with Raw Lamb, Black Harissa, Parmesan Laffa Chip, and paired with Domaine Grand Rosse of Trousseau. Normally, raw red meat makes me nervous. Thank god I just went for it with this dish, meltingly tender, and by now I'm drunk and sure that the whole restaurant knows. Brian must've, he seemed quite bemused. Chilled Tomato Soup with Head-On Shrimp, Horseradish, and an Old Bay infused Bloody Maria. I had halibut instead because me + shrimp = death, but regardless, delicious, creamy smooth - both the soup and the drink ;) Corn Tortellini with Kashkaval Butter, Aleppo-pepper, paired with sweet-corn infused vodka and corn foam. The tortellini was sweet and cooked as well as if Vetri had done so, and the vodka shot was...interesting. We were warned, it was an experiment, but it was surprisingly smoky-sweet, with caramel undertones. Boy I was drunk by then. Grilled Octopus with Green Chickpeas, Smoked Paprika, Saffron Tehina, and I got to try BOTH the fino and manzanilla sherry after getting into a discussion about sherries with Brian. Score! Both on more drinks, AND ridiculously tender octopus. Green chickpeas are my new must-try-at-home ingredient. Appolonia Spiced Foie Gras with Kataifi, Onion, Blueberry Gastrique, and Abbaye St. Bon Chienne Biere de Garde 2012. If you like foie gras, then no worries, this is delish. The beer? Words can't describe - especially because this Abbey makes a different blend every year! Slow Roasted Shortrib with Persian Rice, Wild Mushroom, Black Truffle, and a glass of Domaine Pradeaux Bandol 2007. These guys know their meats, and succulent is the first of many words you'll think of. Rice should only be served Persian-style with that super crispy bottom. YUM. La Tur cheese with Blueberry, Urfa Walnuts, Challah Toast, and Lucashof Pfalz Riesling. I love Riesling. I also love cheese plates. I likely said that out loud when both were served. Fig Sorbet. A palate cleanser that, in all honesty, tasted like a ton of fresh figs that were pureed and frozen solid with nothing else added. We were offered to take as large of a scoop as we wanted from the container. They may have learned to serve their guests themselves after I dug in. Coconut Basboosa with Poached Plums, and a Cardamom Vodka White Russian. The final course. Light in flavor, with a nightcap of a drink to put the final nail in my drunk coffin. Taxi! We made it through all that, and it was worth everything. We didn't actually finish all of the last several entree dishes (and you're not expected to), but we did a damn fine amount of damage. If you don't eat at the Chef's Counter here, you'll regret it. Better than Vetri (I didn't say that).

176099,112807,4864,5.0,1,2015-01-06,"Minetta Tavern There are few restaurants that when you walk through the door bring you back in time the way Minetta Tavern does. It conquers a feeling worthy of an old American novel. It takes you back to a different time; a time when in the same smoke filled bar in NYC you could find Hemingway and O'Niell shoulder to shoulder with Gould and ""The Cinderella Man"" (fitting since they all were regulars). The space is dark woods, black and white tile and a soft light fills the room. The chatter is electrifying and the music plays quietly in the background. When dinning at Minetta be sure to get there early to enjoy one of their many classic cocktails at the bar before being seated for dinner. Having said all that he best part of Minetta is still the food that flows from the kitchen in an effortless manner conducted by your acutely attuned waiter which allows for a perfectly paced meal. When it comes to the food, cow is truly the star. Appetizers like Veal Carpaccio and Roasted Bone Marrow and entrees like the famous Black Label Burger, Côte de Boeuf and Bone in New York Strip all highlight how beef should be done. Must Try Appetizers Huîtres et Crépinettes (Oysters) Roasted Bone Marrow - I know to some this may be out of the comfort zone but do yourself a favor and give it a try. Veal Carpaccio Must Try Entrees The Black Label Burger - Possibly the best burger I have ever eaten. Made from a combination of dry aged prime meats (Ribeye, NY Strip, Skirt and Brisket) all from Pat La Frieda. Topped with perfectly caramelized onions, clarified butter, salt & pepper served atop a specially created bun baked by the owners bakery (Balthazar Bakery).  Mark Pastore, President of Pat LaFrieda Meat Purveyors said this burger is ""like biting heaven."" Dry Aged Côte de Boeuf (for 2) This is the signature steak at Minetta. A beautiful cut of bone in rib eye (same as used for Black Label Burger). The marbling of this cut makes it extremely tender and juicy. Minetta does it right with a nicely charred crust and perfectly cooked center. It is served with roasted bone marrow which compliments the buttery notes of the steak. Bone in New York Strip This is my personal favorite cut on the menu. There is no arguing that the Côte de Boeuf is fantastic but to me nothing feels more like a steak then the NY strip. Just like the ribeye this NY strip is always cooked to perfection. It is a slightly hardier cut which is why I enjoy it. There is nothing fancy about this steak, it's just really good. (It is listed on the menu for one but I would say if you don't want to leave feeling stuffed it can certainly feed two.) Must Try Sides Macaroni Gratin Pommes Aligot About half way through your main course just when you are about to say you are ready to tap out the waiter will come over and remind you that their signature dessert, the Chocolate Soufflé is usually put into the oven around this time of your meal and ask if you are interested in having one. The answer is simply YES. As you can tell you don't come to Minetta for a light meal but it is worth every last calorie. I think it is a must visit for any real New Yorker or anyone who wants a taste of old school New York. In full disclosure Minetta Tavern is not cheap but I would be willing to pay just about any price for this meal.

We should have known...but after spending years of school in the Village and never really noticing this place, we thought we'd found something no one else knew about! :) Anyways, see if you can get a table in the back room. The front is insane with people cramming themselves at the bar. We really liked the bone marrow appetizer; it comes with an onion jam that fits gorgeously with the bread that I think they source from Bathazar. The salted cod is actually a babaganoush-like dip (unexpected, though not un-tasty). The tavern steak was a total throw-away; while cooked well, there wasn't a dash of salt on it, and we actually enjoyed the fries that came with it more. Waiter was kind of a snob, which was funny given the general clientel.

And, having window-shopped reservations through OpenTable a few times, I knew there were only 2 possibilities short of calling a couple of weeks ahead: really early or really late. The gf and I were in early bird mode appetite wise, so I made a 5:30 rez on a Friday. We walked in on the dot and the bar area was already crammed with people waiting for the dining room to open up. For some reason, this took some time and felt like a ritual occurrence. (I guess it doesn't hurt to have the diners sip a drink or two with anticipation before starting the dinner tab...). But the nice cocktail was totally worth its currency when I spotted none other than Rupert Friend, aka Peter Quinn from Homeland, on a very early Friday evening date. I restrained myself from boorish behavior (save for this mention, of course). We were soon seated at a handsome semicircular table that felt intimate despite being right behind one of the wait staff's stations. Just after Thanksgiving but before Christmas, the space felt festive and had that feeling of refuge from the cold winter night. Our server was very hip and knew his stuff. He coached us expertly through the menu. But he knew all roads lead to the Black Label, and ours was no different. I started with Huîtres et Crépinettes (truffled pork sausage with salt pond oysters on the half shell). A very tasty prelude to the main course, but rendered almost meaningless when the burgers arrived. The Black Label is a ""selection"" of prime dry-aged beef cuts with caramelized onions. It comes with fries, which, again, fell into flavor oblivion once that juicy patty melts in your mouth. The waiter advised us to cut the burgers in half and really savor them. This we did. Verdict: very good burger, very high prices (even without dessert or a second drink). If you just want to try the burger, be minimalist about it and get a glass of water to wash it down. But if you want to drop some money and have a good time with friends, parents, or a date, it should be pretty memorable.

They also had a chocolate souffle which was ridiculously rich and decadent. Those are synonyms but I needed both so you'd really feel me on this one.

Sushi quality is pretty good, cuts are clean and fish is fresh. their rice is slightly sticky but holds together well. prefer my rice to be a bit more tart but that's a personal taste thing. miso soup was a bit weak, found maybe 6 tiny pieces of tofu in my soup and the broth was a little flat. Price is about similar to other sushi places, meal came up to about $12 for 3 rolls and soup for lunch. overall not too expensive for a sushi place, reasonable for the quality you get. in terms of sushi, it's not the best food I have eaten but it's not bad either. I would be more interested to see what they do with their other entrees and will probably try them again to check out a specialty roll or two. For those wondering though: it's fresh raw fish on rice, what's not to like?

179730,114351,4995,4.0,1,2015-01-06,"I had this one day after trying Hanco's so allow me to compare the two: Price: Saigon is the clear winner. I believe it was $5 after tax for a very large sandwich. Hanco's is $6.75 + tax for about 25% less sandwich. Neither will break the bank but who doesn't love spending 5 bucks for a huge sandwich? No friend of mine, that's who. Ambiance: Hanco's has a coffee shop feel going for it. Saigon has a... Chinatown feel going for it. Chinatown in the sense that - not only is it obviously in Chinatown - there is (inexplicably) a jewelry stand in the middle of the fairly narrow restaurant. You know, for all those times you've been waiting on your sandwich and impulse-bought a gold bracelet. Sandwich contents: Hanco's wins this one. The pickled vegetables are just a bit more delicious there. They are let down, however by: Sandwich construction: Saigon is a bit better. Both suffer from a peculiar sandwich construction technique wherein all the meat is placed on one side of the sandwich and the veggies on the other which can make them tricky to eat because you can't really eat meat and veggies at the same time. This is a huge flaw that prevents both places from living up to their true potential but it was less of a flaw at Saigon. Overall, both Hanco's and Saigon make a 4-star sandwich but only one of them makes it for $5. Sure, the veggies at Hanco's ARE a little bit better but did I mention that Saigon's sandwiches are bigger? Truthfully, though, both make very excellent banh mi sandwiches and the differences are pretty small.

Everything we had was good, but there was only a wow factor in one dish, the Langos.  There was a flaky bread with smoked beets and a sauerkraut remoulade.  It was tart, tangy and I loved the texture.  Nothing else was that memorable.   Also, the price isn't any cheaper than Vedge by the time you order enough to get full. We spent around $120 for two after tax and tip and my husband was still hungry. The sad part is the menu items aren't as tasty as ones I've had at Vedge.  When I think of street food from the around the world, I think of new exciting flavors.  I just wasn't wowed.   Take the Peruvian Fries for instance.  They are potato wedges with aji amarillo, cilantro, olive, and peanut.  I had a version at Vedge with a curry dipping sauce that was amazing.  There the potatoes were super crisp and the curry sauce was so good we were scrapping the dipping bowl to get every little last bit of goodness out of there.  The potatoes are VStreet weren't so crisp, due to the toppings being placed on top and the sauce was boring.   Drinks wise, it was a mixed bag.  Stay away from the Colonel Mustard in the Library with a Dagger cocktail.  I love mustard, but it felt like drinking packets of mustard mixed with water.  Yuck!  The mustard flavor was overwhelming the cocktail was not well balanced at all.  The Cruz Control on the other hand with tequila and horchata was lovely.  I saw horchata and knew I was going to like that.  It was creamy and slightly sweet and cinnamony.  Yum! I did enjoy the vegetarian version of the dan dan noodles.  The texture of the noodles was nice, and I am a lover of all things mushroom.  It's hard to find a vegetarian version of these.   I guess that's why you pay a premium for them.  The server described it as a very large portion, but it was on a small side for $12.   Don't waste your time with the crunchy papadams.  You can get better ones at pretty much any indian restaurant and better sauce or chutney to go with them.  Also the dessert waffle is nothing special.  My husband even forgot that he had it.  The Korean Seitan tacos were the most filling dish, but was just okay. I let my husband have most of them.  Oh and the pretzel are pretzels.  I don't know what I was thinking, but the server really pushed these.   Dessert was nice.  I had a Halo Halo which is a taro ice cream dish with pickled pineapple and pomegranate seeds.  The mixture of textures and sweet and sour was pleasant.  The whipped topping in dessert wasn't so good, but since it's a Vegan restaurant, I guess their options are limited.   Overall, for this price point, I expected more.  If I'm craving veggie deliciousness, I'll head over to Vedge instead.

I ordered the burger which comes with the works, some type of sauce and bacon onion jam. It was a really tasty choice, but I think I'll have the chicken and waffles next time because they looked delicious too :) The inside is really cutely decorated, loved the feel of it and all the photographs on the walls. Our booth was very cozy. The only reason a star is knocked off is because we waited really long for our entrees, I believe over 35 minutes. It might have been the crippling hunger but we were very aware of the gap between courses. Other than that, excellent spot!

Then, when we were seated in the back (outside?) area there were 3 more tables empty for another hour or so! What were we waiting around for? -Tables and chairs are metal folding ones which you are squished into. Luckily we are all close friends. -White sangria, extremely watered down, and expensive for a pitcher ($40? $45?) -Little bag of free plantain chips after ordering, second serving there's a charge. Even though we ordered the dip sampler appetizer for $14, we still ran out of chips for our dips. -No substitutions to a side on one of their specials, even with a food allergy! Absurd. The only offer was to remove it without replacing the side! (Yet, of course still charge the full $24) And the tipper... -Don't celebrate a birthday here and expect to bring any cake or desserts. I deliberately brought cupcakes (for ease to not have to get a knife, plates, forks) to celebrate a birthday.  When I asked for napkins because I brought cupcakes, the waiter then advised me there is a $2 charge PER PERSON. (At least he gave me the heads up, it's not his policy so I feel bad he's the messenger.) As a principal, I refuse to pay $2 more (x7 people) on top of the automatically added 20% gratuity! Which I'm sure the gratuity would have been higher too if you account for that extra fee! They really could have said, sorry no outside food, but this is just bad business now to charge the fee. (As we were putting on coats to leave, the waiter then comes over and said the manager said it's okay to eat the cupcakes without the charge now... We were already getting ready to leave? Thanks, but no thanks. We were annoyed and sang happy birthday outside on the sidewalk, in the cold. Thanks bogota latin bistro.) Also, there was NO ONE waiting for our table! Not like they needed us out of there. --Never again.

It looks small from the outside, but I was surprised at how far back and spacious it was. They escorted us to an empty back room, that was an outside greenhouse-like setting. It was warm and cozy, and when we got there it was empty. Our server wasn't very attentive and a little quiet, but he was nice and took our orders fairly quickly. We ordered some mimosas, which could have been a little stronger, but they came out fine. When the food came out it was fresh, authentic, and everything we were hoping for. I got to try the empanadas, French toast, breakfast burritos, and benedict. This is definitely where they excelled the most. My only real complaint was the service. It wasn't bad, just nothing special. They must have forgotten to ring in my order because when everyone else's food arrived I had to wait an extra ten minutes for mine.

Prix Fixe menu had a lot of options to choose from. -Loved the decor and overall setup. -Atmosphere was laid back, a great place to enjoy time with friends, family (no children), or a date. -Aguardiente Antioqueño! This is hard to find if you are not in queens! Make sure to have a shot. -Friendly hostess and waitress. CONS: -Where we were seated, all the way in the back, it was really cold. There was heat, but only coming in at certain spots so we were cold the whole time. -Food took a long time to come out, this might've been because it was really busy. However, the dessert also took long to come out which didn't make sense assuming it's already made. -Food wasn't hot, just warm. -Not as colombian as I was hoping. Music was a mix of latin and pop, not much colombian classics were played. Menu didn't have some colombian platters that I'm used to. I'm probably biased because I grew up going to the traditional colombian restaurants in Queens, so I had some expectations going in. Although it seems that I listed more cons than pros, I think that this is a nice spot and I would definitely go back again. I think the less-traditional quality fits the neighborhood it's in and the crowd that I saw.

But it is so city and I loved it! It has hundreds of different food options, all classic Philly meals (donuts, pretzles and philly cheese steaks) as well as hundreds of other options. It is busy and crazy, but the food selection is like no other. THey also have a market, with hundreds of fruits/vegetables that looked so good! They had many butchers with meats and fish that also looked very fresh. This would be a great place to get fresh food if you live in this part o the city... or go to any of the hundreds of venues for pre-made food! I also loved that they had a corner of  ""country store"" type stuff with candles, jams, memorabilia, small candy stores. It is genius, having it all together in the same building.

It does get very crowded, especially on weekends but, to me, that adds to the charm, making it an excellent place to people watch in Philadelphia (while staying warm and VERY well fed).

Definitely have to experience firsthand as words do not do this place justice!

Ice cream is always a good one and the food in general that you can get is awesome, the Greek and Sang Kee counters are probably my favorites other than DiNic's of course. If you get there pretty early you can just walk right up to DiNic's and get a roast beef and to me it's totally ok to have one at 9 am. I only go to Smucker's now for meat and bacon (sometimes I cheat on them with Kensington Quarters now). The bacon prices are the same or cheaper than the supermarket and the quality of what you are getting is miles better. For seafood there is no better place than John Yi's seafood, they consistently have the best and freshest selection of seafood and everyone who works there is super friendly and helpful. All in all there isn't a better place in the city where you can get everything you might need in one spot. Iovine Brothers produce is also a nice little gem in there, this place makes me happy to live in Philadelphia.

Firstly, forget any American food court you have experienced. This is the real deal. Independent suppliers and unique food. Everything from oysters to patisserie. Cheese to rueben sandwich. If you crave it, its here somewhere. We visited twice. Once to take it all in. The second time to eat. Both outings included a couple of beers at the outrageously friendly Molly Molloy's. Our second included onion soup and a caesar salad. Both were outstanding (so was the beer). We then moved to Pearl and enjoyed half a dozen oysters and a crab cake.

When I arrived and stepped inside, I couldn't believe my eyes. I was instantly transported from a dreary cold and rainy day to a vibrant market full of shops and people milling about. I entered by the fresh produce and thought, ""it's like a farmers market"". Wrong. This place is a little bit of everything. Farmers Market. Grocery Store. Restaurant. Fish Market. Bookstore. Winery. Lancaster County Amish goods. Cakes. Pies. It's a you-name-it, they have it kind of place. All of the shops are fairly small but packed. For those of you in Indy, imagine City Market sized businesses, but picture 150-175 of them on a single floor about three times the Indy City Market. Picture lines of people 30 people deep waiting for hand rolled donuts from Beiler's Bakery. Picture small restaurants with seating for only 10 or so people turning out every type of food you can imagine from all over the country. Picture me walking around trying to absorb every piece of this that I could, all the while wondering why Indianapolis doesn't have something so amazingly awesome. Philly, you've won my heart and you've won my stomach. Places like this make me want to come back every weekend just to find another shop that I didn't know existed, but am better for knowing that it does.

We went New Year's Eve 2014 and found the food, wine and service to be excellent. We started with the Tarry Greens which we shared. There was plenty of greens for the both of us- a frisee salad with white bean vinaigrette. For the main course I had the pumpkin sage ravioli. There was plenty of perfectly cooked ravioli to fill me and, man, was it delicious! I had the Bastianich Pinot Grigio to drink which I found to be very bright and tasty. My partner had the salmon which was perfectly cooked (she ordered it medium rare- as salmon should be). She asked for a wine similar to a pinot noir and our server suggested the Pecchenino Dolcetto di San Luigi- which was wonderful and greatly enjoyed. For dessert we had the flourless chocolate cake- served with whipped cream on top and some crumbled pistachios- a tasty end to our dinner. I would like to note that this was NYE and we really didn't know what to expect from the service being that it's a new restaurant on such a busy night- well of course it was a full house and they were all very busy, but the service was perfectly fine and I was not disappointed. We can't wait to go back and try some of the other appealing options on the menu!

Our salads were piled high and beautifully dressed. His Tagliatelle Bolognese was delicious and my linguine with clams equally wonderful. The pleasant surprise was the ""soft serve"" ice cream they offered for dessert. Our flavor choices were olive oil and Varlhona chocolate with our choice of eclectic and sophisticated toppings (aged balsamic vinegar, candied pistachios, pomegranate sauce, etc.). While the chocolate was great, the olive oil ice cream was out of this world. Perfectly subtle and awesome.

192912,31508,1704,4.0,1,2015-01-03,"When I first heard about Tarry Lodge, I thought, ""Not another pizza place..."" because we are already saturated as the land of apizza and froyo (I swear, if another froyo place opens up in New Haven, I will lose it. Those of you thinking of opening up a new froyo joint, let Pinkberry be a lesson to you all!). I then became even more skeptical when I heard about the celeb chef behind TL, Mario Batali (for a refresher, check out my review of Otto in NYC, where I got poisoned from a rancid clam pizza). But making it my goal to review every restaurant in New Haven, I decided to try Tarry Lodge. It was packed on the Thursday night. The ambiance was reminiscent of a crowded Manhattan restaurant, where you sit mere inches away from your fellow diners and a trip to the bathroom can only be made by extracting an entire two-top from an otherwise orderly row of tables against the wall. I liked the preppy feel of the place - a bronzed Handsome Dan donning a Santa hat welcomed us at the doorway and the Yale memorabilia made the just-opened restaurant feel quaint. Now onto the food. The menu is split into the ""professors"" and ""students"" options (i.e., pricier/upscale fare vs. cheaper options, although I fall into the former category and can't afford the professor prices ...), which is nice because it varies the selection. From the starters, we went with the bufala and roasted beets, which was delicious and perfectly balanced with a healthy drizzle of olive oil and salt and pepper. The multi-colored beets accented the rich, creamy mozzarella. We also ordered the octopus with shishito peppers and squid ink. It was not the best grilled octopus I had - it didn't taste fresh or have the characteristic bite you want. Skipping the pasta course, we ordered Guanciale pizza with black truffle and egg. The black truffle obviously came from a jar, as they had already lost much of their pungent fragrance and were merely textural elements atop our pie. The crust was what you'd expect from a well-made neopolitan pie: fluffy and chewy crust, with a think and crispy body. As for the wine selection and list - this is where presumably TL really makes their dime. There is not a single bottle on their wine list under $30, which to me, in a ""student town,"" is unacceptable. They don't sell wine by the glass, but instead offer a glass and a half carafe, which isn't worth it if you and your dining partner are both having wine. To me, this is where TL can definitely improve. Offer a few more affordable wine options (even a house wine in a carafe) and your average ticket will go way up and you'll get repeat customers like myself. In Italy, I was shocked by how delicious and affordable table wine was everywhere I went, as a fine Italian meal is meant to be enjoyed with a glass of wine.

193579,13798,1716,4.0,1,2015-01-04,"In order to write this review, I did some research on the term ""bukkake."" My plan was to use these facts to buttress my argument that Samurai Mama's continual use of this word is a crude, juvelline joke that might be worth a chuckle at first blush but is just off-putting when repeated over and over across the pages of the menu. Some inconvenient facts emerge. It turns out that the English-adoption of the Japanese verb bukkaberu to describe an act of mass male ejactulation on another person is a secondary use of a relatively common Japanese cooking technique. Samurai Mama is mostly off the hook, although even if they are trying to reclaim this language the people behind menu seem to be laughing at the gaijin's discomfort at the graphic menu images conjured at their menu. It's all probably the only joke in the entire restaurant, which combines a large communal table and several nooks that evoke an ryokan high in the mountains of Honshu. A secondary dining room is located through the kitchen, which seems here to be a layout necessity rather than any mission statement about proximity to the food being prepared. The menu is at once limited but expansive. Udon is the focus, and no ramen or other noodles are served (ramen has been kicked over to a less successful sister restaurant, Samurai Papa). Outside of the main course, a feast of smaller plates, both cold and hot are available. Two orders of the kariage could serve as an alternative meal. The menu sticks to Japanese tavern fare, but the edamame is black and the miso soup mixed with long, thin mushrooms. The sushi operates a strange middle ground between the high-end omakase preparations that would be star of an entire restaurant and the overstuffed American-rolls from a takeout place. The selection is large enough to indicate this is no side-show, but not quite good enough to justify a meal on its own. Some are solid - the yellow tail belly, ume Q - but could be excised from a long menu without too much complaint. It's no wonder that subsequent efforts from this group have pared things down, because there's a five-star menu lurking inside the dishes on offer here. Choose carefully and you'll have an excellent meal. Be more willy-nilly and the results will still be pretty good. And they also know how to use the word bukkake correctly, if you're into that.

195730,121787,1741,1.0,1,2015-01-08,"One Star Too Many (but Yelp doesn't allow zero stars) There's new restaurant at Newark airport, so I decided to check it out. Most everything on the menu is not cheap, so I decided to try the burger which wasn't too pricey. To give you an idea, this is a steakhouse similar to a Ruth's Chris. Steak prices range from $28 to $58, but like any good steakhouse, it does not include any side dishes. Side dishes are $9 or $10 each. The least expenses entree (without any sides) is $23. Wine by the glass ranges from $11 to $44 per glass. Get the picture? So here's my complaint. Wait staff has been replaced by an iPad at each table. No customer service whatsoever. Your sommelier apparently has been replaced by the Google app installed on the iPad. You place your order online and somehow it's prepared and ends up on your table almost as fast as McDonald's or Burger King. This the Amazon Prime of steakhouses. You may briefly interact with the delivery person if you don't blink. And the real kicker? For this wonderful service they automatically charge you an 18% gratuity.  I guess you can choose your tip, but insisted the waitress place my order as I knew what I wanted and didn't care to browse the catalog to place an order.  I guess she thought she would deserve a respectable tip.  Anyway, who tips a service person BEFORE you get service?  There was no option to pay later nor tip later which also means there is no incentive for the employees to do well nor care about their job. While I think the iPad ordering concept can be terrific, it's not meant for a place such as this. To replace a few fast food employees who do nothing more than data entry of your order would be amazing. But when I go to a real sit down restaurant, who thinks this is a good idea? At least the food was good, even though the burger was probably overcooked.  I ordered medium rare.  Shouldn't a high end steak house know how to prepare a medium rare piece of meat? In addition, they have no presence yet on Facebook, so I did not ""check in"" there. Which leads me to my next thought. If you are going to make being a high tech innovator your gimmick, why don't you make sure you exemplify that cool factor in all areas of technology with regard to social media? Epic fail guys.

On the flip side, service was great and the restaurant was clean. They had some games on so it wasn't a bad environment but the food is lacking here.

He does not accept coupons unless they are printouts. As such how should a patron print a Yelp offer after they have 'checked in' at the restaurant. His reasoning is that his rent is too high to accept online coupons. 3. He doesn't care the least about his customers.

Being from California, I'd like to think I'm quite adept at judging the quality of a pho bowl. Pho Saigon's broth is light but flavorful and the noodles are cooked just right, not overly done. The only qualm I have is that the soup needs to be hotter. One of the fun thing about eating pho on a cold day is the scorching hot soup that you blow on to cool it, but it'll still burn your tongue. Moreover, Pho Saigon also offers a wide variety of Vietnamese dishes: broken rice, vermicelli, egg noodles, etc. I've had most of the broken rice dishes and love it. It is flavorful yet not overpowering. The Bun Bo Hue tasted pretty authentic too. The portion given here definitely is more than enough to fill you. Additionally, if you've never had Vietnamese smoothies then the Avocado and Durian are a must! A bit on the expensive side (4.80) but it'll keep you coming back for more. A good smoothie needs to be made with real fruit and creamy as a finished product. If it's icy and tastes like powder then you know it's crappy. On a final note, I just wanted to commend the waiters on their great services! At least one waiter will greet and take note of you the moment you walk in; never an awkward moment standing there looking lost. I appreciate how attentive they are to all your dining needs. What's amazing is that they're fluent in Vietnamese and English! They are capable of explaining the dish's elements in English to English-speaking patrons. I've rarely seen any Vietnamese restaurants able to offer this! Thank you Pho Saigon for giving me a bit that homely taste.

The restaurant is small, but the tables are spaced out perfectly so you don't feel like you're sitting on top of other people. The staff was so wonderful and friendly. The owner walks around in the same black t-shirt as everyone else and serves guests. We asked him for some extra bread at one point, not realizing he was the owner of the place. But really, the food is AMAZING and the reason to visit. We struggled on deciding what to order so we started with a few of the small plates. The octopus was cooked perfectly, the falafel was delicious and interesting in the steamed buns, but the shrimp saganaki was by far our favorite. We asked for extra bread so we could soak up the leftover sauce - it was so good. By the time we finished with the three plates, we were getting kind of full, but decided to try the lamb burger anyway, and there were no regrets. The burger was really unique and the za'tar fries were perfect a side. I have to try that at home! Just when we thought we were finished, the server told us the dessert of the night was baklava donuts with a chocolate dipping sauce. We were sold, and even though we were already ""full,"" we ate the entire plate. The saltiness of the pistachio and the sweetness of the honey and chocolate, were a perfect combination. Add fried dough...not sure how it could get any better. They said it was a special for the evening, but they should seriously consider adding it to the menu. I want to go back to try the rest of the food. If you're ever in NYC, you have to give it a try! Just make a reservation because seating may be limited.

The buns are soft and it wraps the falafel perfectly. Brussels sprouts - not good. If you don't like Brussels sprouts, this is not the place to try it out. The bitter taste is still present because they didn't cook it for long. If you take the bite with fig and apple, the bitterness is bearable. Hummus - not fresh! Way too expensive for it's quality.

Also, I had a lasagna special on my last time in that was very underwhelming. On the other hand, the anchovie/lemon/spaghetti dish is consistently satisfying and fresh, and the black linguini is always delicious.   I'd stick to their offerings, not try to create your own, and ask your server for advice.  Great service, btw.  Free bread and olives/olive oil, lovely candlelit atmosphere.  One thing that I hate, but that hasn't kept me from going back, is that Cent'Anni is a restaurant with impossibly small two-tops.  My advice is to sit at the bar so you can be a bit more comfortable if on a date, or come with a group.

Foie Gras Mousse [$15] Apple cider gelee, pommery mustard When I saw that foie was on offer at CTH, I knew that efforts were being made in the kitchen by Executive Chef Ian Branning, who has honed his skills at Ruth's Chris and Stephen Starr's empire of restaurants. I was really surprised at how well this turned out - creamy, yet light, the richness of the foie was tempered by the apple cider gelee. Six grilled toasted points were the perfect vessel for the foie, which was also balanced by the acidity of the pickled red onions and the great dijon mustard. A must order. Ten Spice Wings [$12] House blue dressing, celery, carrots A huge portion of wings had a great dry rub that wasn't spicy and had a texture reminiscent of cornmeal. The chicken was moist and juicy. Celery, carrots, and blue cheese accompanied the wings. Blue Crab Mac n Cheese [$12] Cavatappi pasta, herbed bread crumbs While the mac n cheese could have used more bits of blue crab, the essence was definitely in the creamy cheese sauce. The cavatappi noodles were perfect to hold on to that delicious sauce, with a great al dente texture.At first I thought this was a pittance of a portion, but the richness of the dish made this just the right amount. Caesar Salad [$10] Romaine hearts, Parmesan crisp, garlic croutons, crispy shallots Considering the onslaught of apps for just 4 of us, the GF opted for a lighter option for her entree. The salad was dressed well, without being drowned in Caesar dressing. A thick Parmesan crisp, garlic croutons, and bits of crispy shallots rounded out each bite. Braised Short Rib [$21] Truffled parsnip puree, radicchio, salsa verde, shaved horseradish I went with a heartier dish of short ribs. While the meat could have use a bit more seasoning, they were fall-apart tender and there were three decently sized portions of meat. The buttery and subtly sweet parsnip puree was lightly accented by the truffle oil, though I missed the shaved horseradish. The star of the dish for me though? The raddichio which had some acidity (pickling?), which I enjoyed. CTH is not just a bar offering pub food. It's on par with a gastropub, offering great bites with some creative twists. On top of the good food, the service was on point as well. We had a great, snarky waitress from Brooklyn and the manager Andrew managed to stop by to check things out. On a Friday night at 7PM, it was bumping and everyone seemed to be enjoying their drinks and food. Considering we live only a few blocks away, I'm sure we'll be by again. Teetered closer to 5 stars than 4, so here's to 5 - hopefully the rest of 2015 solidifies this great start for City Tap House at Logan Square!

198037,24570,1768,4.0,1,2015-01-02,"I've been to City Tap House (Logan Square) a few times now, but each time for drinks only.  I'm so glad to see Public House shut down and this amazing beer bar in its place!  City Tap House offers 40 something draft beers, its really crazy how many beers they have on tap.  The entire wall is lined with taps, and you get a clip board of pages long of craft beer options. The bar is huge, so you can usually find a seat around the bar, or at a high-top.  The seating area for dinner is also huge, so if you can't get a bar seat, have the hostess seat you at a table.  I love sitting at the bar though, because of all the beer choices, I like to get the bartenders feedback on different beer options, and perhaps try a few free samples.  The service is spotty; the first time I went, it was packed and took me over 10 minutes to be recognized at the bar.  Its unfortunate, but a simple ""i'll be right with you"" would have helped!  However, the next time I went back, the bartenders were amazing and the one guy even talked to me for a while, and had me try a few samples of beer of his favorites.  So, that made me really happy!  He was great. Never tried the food, but if its the same as City Tap House in University city, then the food will be pretty good.  I can't wait to go back, I'll order food next time.  The bathrooms are unisex, so don't get confused, you're walking into the right place!   City Tap House is certainly a beer heaven for craft drinkers like me!  Great new addition to Logan Square.  I'll be back!

We ended up having a cannoli for desert which I *thought* I didn't want because I was stuffed...but after the first bite I died and went to dessert heaven and inhaled that thing within like 4 seconds. It was SO, soooooooooo good!!!! Now the important part and what puts this place over the top....the service here was absolutely incredible. Everyone, literally every person that was working there, was so friendly and happy (or at least they were great at acting happy, lol). Our server Mike made our NYE celebration even more wonderful. I seriously can't say enough good things about that guy, he was so nice and took such great care of us while we were there (I would go as far as to say that he's probably the best server I've ever had!).

They were cheap on the sour cream and their only waiter took a break to eat so we didnt get to have refills on water. The spot is cosy. Dim lighting and kinda romantic. The fried pierogies were decent but not really all that. The salad was very good though. The potato pancakes were very oily. It was a decent outing though.

199238,24522,1780,4.0,1,2015-01-06,"What's my favorite thing about the Cornerstone Cafe? ... probably that it's my best friend on an early weekend morning. Sometimes I have things to do beyond the 10 o'clock hour and that tends to interfere with epic brunch time. Thankfully, Cornerstone is open as early as 8 AM and while they do not take reservations, the wait tends to go by quickly if you happen to swing by after the 10:30-11:00 hour during the weekend. Next favorite thing about this place? Definitely the money you'll be saving. This is where you go to save money on brunch--it's cash only and most of their options will leave you surprised at how cheap it is. Commingle this with the fact that there are frequently Groupon deals (at least last year when I frequented this place), you'll be reveling in a steal of a deal at this place. Food is good. Not revolutionary, save the world, kind of good... but definitely good. I recommend the breakfast options more than the brunchy-er options, but entirely your choice. The Texas french toast and pancakes are both solid selections, and the potatoes are yummy (though a smidge lacking in seasoning). I've yet to see them botch my eggs or anything either, so good on that end! Portions are quite favorable and your selection will leave you stuffed! Definitely take the time to check this place out when you're nearby Alphabet City, especially if you're looking to save a buck or two. You've got all your standard frills here. While the dishes may pale in comparison to other nearby brunch places (Clinton St, I'm looking at you), that does not mean it's not worth your time. I've been here numerous times and will definitely take the time to return again.

Thinnish crispish crust, interesting topping assortments, approachable in size. We ordered 2 and had a couple slices leftover. Because the delivery food was so mmmm, I was dying to try it in person. This was a good decision.   The place itself is really cute - I'm hands in for the design. It's clean and geometric yet still interesting. It's not huge so you feel like a hungry person, not an am-i-invisble number. Though the food was again fantastic, what REALLY sealed the deal for me was one small thing that rocked my entire mothereating world: It happened so fast. I moved my arms from leaning on the table, and there was a slight wobble to the base. I thought in my head, how does this always happen to me, and then quickly forgot. I didn't even think anyone else noticed. A few minutes later, our server came back out, got on all fours beneath us, and with one swift motion placed a cork under the table and stopped the wobbling. * WHAT! * It was amazing. I felt so loved, I felt like our server empathized with my experience, and was totally in tune to what our experience would be. I know that it's small and random but c'mon only someone that takes pride in the end goal of their server position would have done this. Or he thought I was sexy. Either way, our water and wine was never left untended to either. What a magical server and A++ impressive experience.

I can't remember what music was playing at all but overall this little Cuban spot left a good impression. The churrasco was good. It wasn't the best but good ,and that entree easily fed 2 people. The paella was good & huge too. I especially liked that they added chicken & sausage with the usual seafood. Nothing that I had was stellar. Nothing was exquisite. There's no reason I'd ever plan to come back, but I wouldn't avoid the place either.

They have several different types of mussels that have some of the best sauce (we were dipping bread, and anything else we could find into it). My son had the fish tacos which he loves anyway but he found these particularly tasty. The seafood market was top notch as well - they had shrimp cocktail and a myriad of other to-go options to purchase that were on ice.  The fish looked fresh too The oysters on the half shell were briny and delicious - I could have eaten 3 dozen of them. They have a deal where if you order a dozen oysters you can get a house wine for $6 which was a good deal.  We ordered a second round and when we got the bill they had it on there full price.  Apparently the deal for the house wine is for every dozen oysters you order you get the discounted price.  To be fair - when we brought it up they gave us the discounted price anyway but it might be a good idea to make it a little clearer on the menu.

Tables are very tights; there's literally no space between the tables.  It's fine when there aren't many other diners but otherwise it's very cramped. Certain entree portions were small.  Fish and chip portions were small for $18.  Not many fish pieces were given.  The fries were a bit too soggy but the old bay seasoning was tasty tho salty.  At least they gave ketchup and tartar sauce.  Breading on the fish was too heavy.   In looking at the table next to us, the fish taco entree was small too.  Only had two tacos, I think.  Not worth the high price tag. For the price paid, the portion, food quality (aside from the grilled whole fish), service, and vibe/atmosphere were not up to par.

The salsas were a combination of three different types: green chili, tomatillo, and a smoky chipolte. We both loved the two green salsas best. Finally, the tacos Al Pastor were sweet with the pineapples and  balanced with the pork and lime. The owner was very attentive to all patrons, as were the wait staff.

There were some special beers listed on the board but I wanted some sort of a cocktail, so I asked to see a menu. So far so good. The people I was with decided to get something to drink, went up to the bar, came right back with drinks. I got my menu, decided what I wanted, went up to the bar said hi to the bartender while looking right at him, then he turned around and started talking to some of the people seated at the bar, OK,I'll wait until he's done, he can see me he's turned to my side, but then turns his back to me and talks to some other people. OK, they were there 1st maybe they asked for more drinks. no, he's not making anything. He rings up a tab, OK I get that too. But now I've been there about 10-15 min. Finally he turns towards me I ask for my drink, he makes it, a waiter comes up he makes a drink for him and then rings me up.

So I am between 2 pork dishes. I ask the waiter, who was very friendly, great service which he would pick, he says they are both good but one of the dishes  is a cold dish so I go with the sizzling sisig. I really should have known what it was before I ordered it, and that's on me. There is a lot of gristly bits in it, it's the nature of the dish. Had I known I would have ordered something else, BUT it was very flavorful and the meaty bits were good, I just couldn't eat the gristle. But here's the kicker 1 of us is vegetarian, so she asks him for a recommendation, guess what he is a vegetarian too!! so how did he know both pork dishes were good???? I don't know, wish he would have told me. Anyway we got the deviled eggs, they were really really good. Someone had the burger, said it was good, I tried the potatos that came with it, they were ok, more like chips than fries. I guess my expectations were too high for what the whole experience was.

They were very accommodating and ended up having the ingredients to make vegan pancakes, but it would have been easier if hey updates their menu or stated somewhere that it was seasonal. Parking can be a pain I that area. We had reservations but even though it was a large group for brunch at nooning a Sunday, we could probably have done without reservations.

206271,10066,1826,3.0,1,2015-01-01,"I had higher hopes per all the rave reviews for this place, our experience, unfortunately wasn't of the majority. We were seated in the rear near the kitchen, so unfortunately there wasn't as much ambiance back there as the front of the restaurant, it did overlook a little Al Fresco dining area, which would be great during the warm weather. It is a cute little space and the staff were friendly, but the prices are pretty steep for being in South Philly with inconsistent food. Our server was friendly and very attentive, made wonderful recommendations and really gave us great insight as to how the dishes were prepared. However, the bus boy was VERY clumsy and definitely took away from the dining experience, he accidently put his finger in our olive oil, when he brought it to the table. When he was delivering and clearing the plates, there was a lot of loud clanging of the dishes together, which really interrupted our conversation and startled me a couple of times. Afterwards, he didn't wipe down our table top for the final course, which left splotches of said oil all over the table. Moving onto the food; The oil and bread for the table was not as memorable as we have had in other places. We felt it was unflavorful and the bread was a little stale. We had to ask for pepper to spice it up a bit. The bus boy placed it down in front of us without as so much as a word, and left. (per the restaurant's comment- it's clearly steeped in history, but we again, we got nothing out of him)(FYI- I got a quick lesson about 25 year old balsamic vinegar at Del Posto, I still remember and appreciate it.) plus his finger in the oil made it that less appetizing. The $29 meat and antipasti platter was over priced and the selection all had the same fatty texture- I was surprised there wasn't a more diverse variety- after a brief schooling in fatty meats, fat is flavor/cured in-house, etc (per referenced below) I still prefer my fat rendered in a pan, not gelatinous in my mouth. The selection of meats were just not to 'our' cup of tea and we start of many dinners with this same platter. (Osteria, Mercato and even Tria does a charcuterie platter for a fraction of the price and they are really delicious!) I did however enjoy the antipasti which was a selection of pickled eggplant, artichoke, tomatoes and onions. The Chilled Octopus Salad- I did know it was a cold salad, but cold octopi and potatoes are an unfamilar combination to me, but it had did nice flavor. The pasta dishes truly saved our bumpy start! DH had the appetizer portion of the Maccheroni alla chitarra con ragu d'agnello- which was delicious pasta with lamb should ragu in a tomato sauce and for the main course, he had Maccheroni alla mugnaia- which was a garlic and olive oil pasta.  We really liked the variety of chili peppers are presented table side and you can use the scissors to spice up your plate, we WERE told it was the traditional Italian way to spice your meal in Italy- this is the first time I've seen this. DH got a little carried away with the peppers as they put out some intense heat! After eating all that pasta, I thought he would be overstuffed, but he said it was surprisingly light and just the right amount. I had the Trota which is the ruby red trout with celery root and cauliflower purée- the fish was nicely cooked and the presentation was what I expected from the reviews- simply beautiful. It was a smidge over salted, but not bad. I do wish the skin was a little crispier as it was appeasing to the eye, but a little smooshy in texture, but I did enjoy it, the fi We don't stray far from center city, but the prices were not what we expected! Don't get me wrong, I'm ALL for paying for a great dining experience,( $14 glass of Bail Hayden- DH will still order it, because that's what he likes, but Yikes!) quite honestly though for nearly $200 ( sans dessert!) I feel we should have had a more enjoyable time. I don't need the justification of a cost analysis on restaurant overhead. I get it, (excuse MY ignorance, but don't all restaurants have the similar costs regardless of location? Non? Do some places get discounts?) but some more interaction would have made the bill more palatable to absorb, is all. I'm so confused how my fellow yelpers experiences vastly differed from our evening there, it must have definitely been an off night or the post holiday lull. Just our luck:( Did anyone else got the full run down of the owner's comments- table side?  We cleary did not, again a little more communication on the staff's part would have really made our experience dramatically different and much memorable. They are obviously passionate about their food, but we wouldn't have known either way. PLEASE... TELL me about the food. Too much information is better than no information at all! Like Francis stated- facts matter, BUT we were barely given any that night. Unless restaurants expect their patrons to be culinary experts when dining out...

Their portions are quite large, so be prepared to munch down then head towards a food coma. My husband had the country fried steak which was prepared fresh for us along with mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. It was all delicious. The mac and cheese wasn't 5 stars, but you can definitely tell it was homemade. I had the pulled chicken or pork (I don't quite remember) sandwich. It cam simply as a huge, larger than your mouth can fit sandwich and that was delish! We also ordered the fritters as an appetizer. It probably would've helped if we had more people with us to finish that portion. The restaurant also has tons of desserts that are made from scratch - they had just made and was cooling a huge tray of peach cobbler. If we weren't overblown with food in our stomachs I think we would've ordered it. Great place to go for a chill night with good food and very nice company.

207336,127110,1844,4.0,1,2015-01-05,"Let me preface this review by admitting my tolerance for spicy food is low. Even though my grandmother hails from Sichuan and most of my family can't eat a meal without a side of spicy red pepper. With that said, I'm very familiar with the mala flavor (numbing-spicy) and know it when it's authentic. My friend and I dined here on a Sat afternoon after choosing not to go to Han Dynasty across the street because my friend was specifically craving for spicy food. Although Han Dynasty has some spicy dishes, they are not Sichuan - Han Dynasty's flavor is more Taiwanese. Unfortunately, the Old City location is more Americanized now but I'll take that to their page... Anyway, please don't compare these 2 restaurants, their Sichuan offerings are NOT the same! It was my friend's turn to order on this outing so we had: Chinese chive pie, bean jelly with Sichuan sauce, spicy beef noodle soup and crispy spicy cucumbers. I've never had the Chinese chive pie and have never seen it on any menu. It's basically a flattened bread stuffed with little bit of chives, some vermicelli noodles and a little bit of eggs. Apparently, it's a regional snack and even though I'm not a fan of chives, this thing was delicious! In case you're wondering what the heck is ""bean jelly,"" it's a clear, wide noodle - you'll want to use a fork and spoon. Anyway, don't hesitate to ask for help, they're very friendly and happy to make recommendations if you want to try authentic Xi'an dishes. They were also able to dial down the spiciness on the dishes we ordered but I somewhat regret they had to do it. I think the spicy beef noodle soup probably would've been spectacular if I could've tolerate it! I hope this location do well; it's such as nice option in this area!! I can't wait to go back.

Okay, now what REALLY stood out about this place was their pork charshu!  Unlike any other I've had anywhere.  Noted on the menu, Minca only uses 100% Berkshire Pork.   Often regarded as the highest quality pork in the world, dare I say this is the pork-equivalent to wagyu/kobe beef?! Berkshire pork, prized for juiciness, flavour and tenderness, is pink-hued and heavily marbled from a rare breed of pig. (wiki).  I was so glad to have ordered an extra side of the pork charshu which included 4 more pieces.   Just by looking at this marbled wonder, you would expect an amazing experience in your mouth.   The pork was melt-in-your-mouth instantly, yet ridiculously juicy, tender, and an explosion of flavor all at once.     Who needs ramen?  Give me a plate of this with some rice! There were many more selections of ramen including miso, shoyu, and various spicy ramen including kimchee ramen which I'll have to try my next time in New York. There is no wonder why lines can be long outside this little establishment during peak hours.  The food is just that good.

I notified a server and about 10 minutes later a manager came by. He offered us new dishes but by then we were almost done. Then they offered us a new table about 5 minutes later and we were ushered across the room to an even smaller table.

Generally I get a little concerned when I hear about 'fusion' food cause usually that means two things, 1) the price has been raised 2) flavors tend to get muted in an attempt to make it palatable for everyone and ends up being less authentic. Thankfully this was NOT the case here. The food had bold thai flavors and tasted great. Things I tried:: lamb roti potpie, and thai burger. Thankfully I had friends willing to share and I was able to try both of these things. The potpie had a roti on top of it. Came in a cute small iron skillet and tasted really great. Soft pieces of lamb and the roti on top was pretty good. There was no crust inside, just on top but its probably better that way since there's less fat. The thai burger was excellent. I was expecting some muted vague spice taste but instead it was extremely flavorful and packed quite a bit of heat. It's definitely worth trying since it's quite different from an ordinary burger you'd get.

209774,128013,1222,2.0,1,2015-01-02,"Ugh. I will not be returning after previous reasonable visits. The nouveau part of this cooking style has a serious downside. The service was compassionate, the food was really bad. I rarely will say any food is bad, but it was, and not due to any lack of individual palette adaptability. The Somtum Authentic Clay Mortor papaya salad did not come with ""fresh green papaya,"" but with papaya that was overly sautéed in the most bitter anti-flavoring. This wasn't the type of tasteful Angustora or leafy bitters. The original fruit was not recognizable. It barely was edible, but I was really hungry. The overpriced ($12) pomelo that was served in a cocktail glass helped make the papaya go down. After that, the Authentic Old School Pad Thai was so bad it was not able to be eaten by my companion. The accommodating waiter was attentive and understanding, and quickly brought us a menu to review for another dish, making helpful suggestions based on our feedback on the original entree. (Maybe this happens often.) We were grateful for his compassion, and were not charged for this pad thai plate. We seldom send anything back to the kitchen, even if there is a mistake in the order, so saying ""no"" after a forkful is uncommon for our otherwise humble dining. I ordered the vegetable and tofu red curry, asking to hold the zucchini if it had any, since it seemed to show up in many of the winter entrees. The only vegetables in it were little portions of basil, red peppers, and green peppers. There were not even cheap filler vegetables, such as carrots, baby corn, or onions. The cook clearly did not know how to improvise, and/or the recipe genuinely is not smart to be excluding so many vegetables. Never again.

Crab Paella: Strong flavor. Lots of chunk of crab. I'd say this dish should get the reviews that Kale Paella has got. Half portion is enough especially if you are to do shared/tapas style with group. I would get this one again. Carrot Yogurt: Lots of carrot. Great yogurt sauce. Carrot is tender and works great with the sauce. Again, strong taste. I'd like to get it again. For tapas, you need to choose 3 plates for $17. Here's what we got. Eggplant: Eggplant is nicely soft and melt in your mouth. Balsamic sauce accommodates to the eggplant nicely. Knowing that eggplant absorbs lots of oils, I still enjoyed. Potato: Flavor is pretty much the same as mashed potato. What different is the texture. The millefeuille  gives you different texture. I liked it. Not too salty but more creamy, thanks to the sauce between the thin potatoes. Lamb: Did not think it's memorable. Tasted like lamb. The sauce was good, so make sure to have the meat with the sauce. I would skip this next time. Walnut Cake: Good! Not too dense. Moist. It is sweet but not overtly sweet. Reasonable individual portion. 4 star for food. 3  1/2 for service (waiter didn't come for 15-20 mins after seated. After that, they were okay though). 4  1/2 as Bobby Flay's restaurant experience. To me, Bobby Flay's food tastes strong and I would not go crazy about it, but I enjoy when it's a vacation or special occation. So if you are here to enjoy as special occation, this is a good choice.

Su Xing's lunch specials are a real deal.  Monday through Saturday, 11:00 to 3:00, lunch specials come with your choice of soup, side, and rice.  Platters vary in cost, but tend to hover around $7 and top out around $9.  Free delivery starts at 2:00, and  my guilty pleasure is to place a delivery order between 2:00 and 3:00 pm on Satuday to get the lunch special deals. My only complaint is that all of Su Xing's dishes lack heat.  Chili oil is definitely needed to kick the dishes up a notch.

The ONE thing I needed to do on my trip to NYC was to eat an authentic Chinese meal in Chinatown, and boy did this place deliver. Tucked away on a small little street, Joe's is hands down the best Chinese food I've ever eaten. Here's a look at what we ordered for 5 people: Soup dumplings: 2 orders, pork. Make sure you order these first as they can take a while sometimes. The soup inside the dumpling just explodes in your mouth when you take a bite and there's really little else in the world much better. Kung Pao Chicken: perfect. Not too fried and the right ratio of chicken to vegetables and peanuts. Beef w/Broccoli: amazing. The flavor of the beef and sauce is picked up by the broccoli and it was cooked to just the right consistency. String Beans: SOOO GOOD! Fried perfectly and still al dente. Pork Lo Mein: yummy Chicken Fried Rice: two thumbs up Spring Rolls: we ordered 5, but the waiter suggested only 3. We thought this meant they would be massive, but they were just slightly over-sized. We could have done 5, but still glad we went with only 3. I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone visiting NYC. I will just keep dreaming about Joe's until I can one day return.

Let me tell you the sad story of a group that was sat at the table with us. Before you walk in the door, there is a big sign that says no credit cards, cash only. It's the first thing you see. So we got sat at a big round table with 2 groups, one of them Asian and the other a group from who knows where but it was some other part of this country. The server comes and asks if we would like some dumplings for appetizers and we said yes, then he asked her and she asked if they had vegetarian dumplings. He said no. She kept asking if he could make it vegetarian and he said no, they make it in advance. She asked what kind of meat, he said it was pork. Then she made this look on her face as if she was stunned and couldn't eat anything. He walks away, then she starts talking to her group and tells them that it's only pork. Well when we get our dumplings, they were delicious. Sticking to each other a few of them ripped open and we lost the juice unfortunately. But the lady at our table proceeded to order some beef entrees. 10 minutes later, she's calling the waiter over to ask if she could change one of her entrees to a fried rice instead. He politely told her no and even got her some free rice. Well, when we were paying our bill, she figures out that it's cash only because the little boy next to her told it's cash only. She looks stunned as if this is some kind of unknown practice. My group and I are just whispering to each other about how funny this whole situation is and politely leave with lots of laughter in our bellies as well as the wonderful food here. Watching that whole ordeal happen was some of the best entertainment I've ever had at a restaurant. So the scoop here is that the dumplings are great, the food is good, and don't be like the lady at my table...

But this is not one of those places. You walk in and the patrons are 98% out of towners. This is what we call a tourist trap. You do not have to go here ""just to experience it"" because Betsy from book club said it was amazing. Break the cycle and make your own choices and actually enjoy yourself instead of suffering through ""an experience."" I went here with a couple out of town friends because they heard it was really good. *sigh* I should have know. But they brought up soup dumplings. I love soup. I love dumplings. I love soup dumplings! How could this be bad? First of all, you will wait. And if it's cold and/or precipitating, you will hate it. The service was horrendous! From the hostess to the server, everyone was SOO rude! It was one of the worst ""restaurant"" experiences I've ever had. I've been in NY for over 10 years and a server for most if that time, and I was shocked at how rude they were. I always tip 20% or over (I'm usually pretty understanding if a server forgets water or to put the sauce on the side - it happens) and I wanted to leave 0 tip here. But of course THEY ADD A 15% AUTOMATIC GRATUITY or else nobody would ever leave anything. The dumplings were just ok. I tried the pork soup dumplings and they were pretty bland (although I do tend to prefer more savory, salty broths). When I broke one open, the ""meat"" was pretty unidentifiable. And all of the dishes my friends and I tried were no better than a cheap take out place. And it was pretty awkward with everyone trying to talk about how good the dumplings were, but you could tell no one really thought they were worth it. Want some good food? Try the ramen place around the corner - Bossanova. Now THEY now how to whip up a good broth. Or go to Queens and get some REALLY good soup dumplings for much cheaper (although still some short waitstaff). Look around and you'll find SOO many options that are amazing.

He was friendly and knowledgeable but wasn't too pushy or sales-y, which I appreciated. The menu was very simple but everything sounded amazing.

But I want to share one particular experience that I'll never forget! It was NYE 2014 and I wanted to do something special for my husband and I; as we had had quite a year. So, being the ""planner"" that I am, I decided to take him to his ultimate fave restaurant. I made the reservation for 7:15 on 12/31, but got to thinking, I want to make something more out of this night. So, I wrote the restaurant a message through their website that I wanted to surprise my husband by booking a hotel in Center City, excusing myself from dinner after we finished and having him meet me at the hotel by leaving a note at the table. Well the GM of Sampan, whose name is Derek, reached out to me immediately and said he would be more than happy to assist me with this! Derek and I e-mailed back and forth for about a week, putting my plan into place! I gave him my card info so that dinner would already be paid for once I excused myself from the table that night and his part was to bring the ""bill"" over to my husband with the note inside, and it worked out PERFECTLY!!! Derek had the hostess, our waiter and another staff member involved so that everything went smoothly. He even went back over to the table 10 minutes after dropping off the ""bill"" and telling my husband that I took care of everything and to enjoy the rest of his NYE. But lets not forget about the food! - we started out with the Chicken Bao Buns which are soooooo yummy. The buns are a little sweet, and very soft - they compliment the glazed chicken very well! We also had the cheesesteak potstickers (which I had to myself because my husband doesn't eat beef or pork) and the Cantonese Spring rolls...Mmmm mmm! For our main course we had the Schezuan Chicken and the Duck Fried Rice - both of which are shareable because they give you generous portions! It saddens me to say that we didn't have dessert, and I ALWAYS get dessert lol, but I was stuffed by the time we had eaten everything. I want to end this by saying, if you haven't been to Sampan, get there! If you have, and you have bad things to say - you must not be much of a foodie or something is wrong with your taste buds. Thank you Sampan (and Derek) for our memorable NYE!!! We'll see you again soon!!

The first six courses were 2 paper thin slices of fish.  One course was a single piece of tempura. The final course was a full sushi roll.  We are not big eaters but this was not a lot of food for the money.  Then they had the nerve to charge us $28 for the tip.  Don't charge me 20% of the full price for such poor service.  It took a good 5 to 10 minutes to open the wine then she spilled it all over the table as she tried to pour it in our glasses.  The servers didn't explain the courses. We had to ask what each thing was.  We left their absolutely furious.  Don't make the same mistake.  Just go to sushi palace. You will get all you can eat good sushi for 1/4 of the price.   Wish I could give less than one star.

No big deal since you can wait next door at their wine bar and enjoy some drinks before your table is ready! Once at the restaurant we ordered what felt like a feast. First we started with the Calamari and Fried Shrimp - very good. Next we had the Lasagna - exceptional - and the gnnochi - pretty delicious. Both had decently sized portions (probably more lasagna than one person could eat for sure, but somehow I finished it off anyways). We were wayyy too stuffed for dessert, so I can't comment on that. Although they were jam packed and busy, the staff was very attentive and easy to get what we needed. I would definitely recommend this for a cozy night with your significant other or friends.

For the entree, I had the Tagliatelle alla Bologese but I think I liked my boyfriend's dish better, he had the Gramigna con Salciccia e Peperoni. My sister had the Tagliolini ai Frutti di Mare and her friend had the lasagna which had a bunch of layers! If they ask if you want cheese, your answer is yes, it's fresh!

Food: Most memorable dish was the Gnocco Fritto (it was nothing special but the best of my meal-- got it with cold cuts-- fried puffy dough was like a nice thin warm croissant). In terms of pasta, I ordered the Tagliolini ai Frutti di Mare. It was okay, nothing special (although I prefer the pasta to be al dente). The flavors weren't quite hitting any spot. Friends got Gramigna con Salciccia e Peperoni, Tagliatelle alla Bolognese and Lasagna. The Gramigna was similar to the Tagliatelle (although I do prefer the Tagliatelle a bit more even if it were elbow macaroni). The Lasagna did not have a lasting impression on me. It was decent. Overall, the food was ok and good for its price. Ambiance: Place is really small. Not too loud in there even if the tables are literally 6 inches from each other. Really cramped. Restroom was a tad dirty and it was freezing in there! Service: Service was average. It was hard for the waitress to squeeze through to our table since we were seated toward the corner. They also forgot to mention the specials and the accent was pretty hard to understand. OH, NO RESERVATION AND CASH ONLY! The Bottom Line: No wait for me on a rainy Saturday evening. I probably won't be back here. The food was good only in relation to their price. Other than that, I believe I had better Italian food elsewhere. Sorry Bianca.

Picture something half the height, alone on its plate, topped with burnt cheese, and  layers of over salted, over cooked meat sauce between what looked and tasted like wet cardboard.  Does the head chef ever taste what comes out of the kitchen? I wouldn't serve this dreck to my worst enemies dog. We dined early this past Sunday before the theater and it appears that we were served inedible, warmed over leftovers from Saturday .Once the entrees were delivered the waitstaff ignored us so we left that entree on the plate, paid our check, and picked up a bottle of soda to wash the taste out our mouth before heading uptown.

I haven't had one bad thing so far and I've been here many many times. While the service is a bit slow, the food is well worth the wait. My absolute favorite part of Positivitea is hands-down the fact that they actually have Vegan soft serve!! (Or as they call it, N'ICE' KREAM) I don't believe I know of any other place that offers it. The selection of sundaes is vast. I particularly love the All Jersey and the Mr. Cookie Munster. They even have Vegan marshmallows! There's a seasonal selection of flavors like pumpkin and eggnog (sans egg). They added cookies and cakes to the selection, but I have yet to try them because I love the ice cream so much. Their selection of loose teas (coconut rooibus is the best!!), smoothies, and fresh juices is exquisite. As for entrees, my favorites are The Mediterranean (I recommend getting the chili sauce on the side unless you love spicy and a runny nose while you're trying to eat your food) and Garden of Vegan. The quinoa chips and the kale salad are equally delicious. Whatever they make the chip sauce drizzle with makes me want to put it in an IV and hook it up to me! I think it's avocado. Whatever it is, it's amazing! The service and atmosphere/decor leave something to be desired. I feel as though they're still feeling their way through the process and that's perfectly normal.

They were out of the appetizer i wanted (pecorino with almond honey), so i guess i just have to come back to try it! one gripe- i always drink water.  why please tell me, is water $5?? since when did restaurants start charging for tap water? This left  a bad taste in my mouth - but thankfully i polished off my meal with a yummy latte to clear that bad taste.  I am normally an outspoken patron, and would have mentioned it to the waiter, but my husband rushed out the door before i had the chance.

As good as the bowl was, my friend tried it and actually chewed on a piece of glass! Apparently a thermometer had exploded in the kitchen and pieces had fallen in the food. In these situations, my friend would usually freak out, but we kind of just nervously laughed it off and moved past it with the way the waitress handled it. The place has gotta be good if I'm still giving it 4 stars even after the fact that there was glass in the food haha! It reminded me of Native Foods, and I love that place.

Between the hype that causes BK restaurants to jam-packed during the hours of 11-2 every weekend, hipster servers who view their job duties as suggestions rather than requirements, and the food that is always more style than substance, it's important to separate the good places from the bad. I'm loving Martha's cozy wood and tile interior and funky decor. It just feels friendly, and the service is no exception. We ordered 4 dishes to share: Sunny egg with greens, Sunny eggs with spicy pork, Thai egg salad, and Brussels sprouts. In hindsight, we might have been a little egg-heavy on our ordering and it was only at the recommendation of the server that we add on the sprouts. We enjoyed all of the dishes, but the spicy pork and sprouts were the standouts. The Sunny egg and pork was a rich and filling combination, and yes the pork is actually spicy! The Brussels sprouts dish was the real winner though. Holy crap. These are amazing! I could have ordered this dish just for myself (noting this for future visit). The spicy peanutty combination with the roasted sprouts is spot on. I probably wouldn't order the sunny egg with greens again, it was tasty but not nearly as interesting as the other dishes. As an added bonus, we're almost 100% positive that Bryan Cranston was sitting behind us.

It seems like some people either don't know where they're going or they have never had something different than  Macaroni and Cheese in their lives. Some people here need to re-watch some Sesame Street or go back to Chicago. First of all you can't just walk into a place because it has good reviews, if you don't like octopus trying to go to a place where that is the specialty and then complain about things like taste and texture only makes you an idiot. I'm not saying that some people didn't have bad experiences at Martha but complain because the food wasn't what you expected is just childish. If I go to a french restaurant and I order escargot and they serve me snails how is that anybody's else fault but mine? Seriously, if you are an expert in shishito peppers you should know that those aren't the most spicy peppers in the world and it seems to me that you have never tried real Indian food or Mexican for that matter. So yeah, some food at Martha is spicy and if you can't take it is maybe because you are not ready and there won't be enough shishito peppers in this world that will make you strong enough. I will recommend you to revalue your concept of spicy as is totally wrong.

Eggplant and hummus was a huge hit! I enjoyed the salads too but the other two were the stars. -calamari was sautéed in a beautiful sauce and was such a nice change to the usual way calamari comes -last but not least, the lava cake was baked perfectly, balanced with the vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce This place is truly special.

Unfortunately, the quality and tastiness of my selection - an omelette with chicken sausage, scallions, mushrooms and cheddar cheeses, accompanied by a large slice of wheat toast and a small mound of shredded potatoes - wasn't all that great. The omelette was rather dry and oddly bland,while the toast was a bit burnt. Also odd was that the toast came with cinnamon butter, which in my opinion was quite disassociated with the rest of the dish. My partner had a deal more lunch with her selection of pulled pork benedict and side of cheddar grits. The former was above average to good, while the latter was downright scrumptious.

Too hot inside especially in long sleeves during the winter. My eggs with style was the traditional American breakfast. Scrambled eggs were nice and fluffy, house made chicken sausage was not good in my opinion but was cooked well. I just didn't like the mixture of flavors in it personally. Biscuits and jam was amazing and so was the potato pancake! My boyfriend ordered the steak and eggs and both were cooked to perfection. Our friends didn't care too much for the fried chicken and waffle. Said the chicken was too much breading and not enough meat. I'd say it was an enjoyable experience, however not quite worth the 1.5 hour wait.

All those other places in NYC? They are delicious, they are classy, but they have been double bagged with an extra lining of America Manhattan. This is pure, raw, unadulterated tofu, fried chicken, addictive cabbage, and alcohol. The East Village is surprisingly quiet on certain streets, amid the bevy of international Asian students clutching their posh designer handbags, grungy children of the dark, and occasional Vegan/Vegetarian/Pescawhateverian. I love this dark street. It had just rained and the ground was slick and gleaming. A wooden sign sits quietly in front of the restaurant, with painted characters and directions, greeting you, and subtly hinting that yes, this may be different. The light inside the restaurant is bright, warm and friendly. It opens at 6 on Sunday. Ok, let's do this. The restaurant is set up with whimsical flair, mixed chairs of different mediums, and unmatched chopstick holders. Ambiance is incredibly casual. Staff appears to have step out one of the cool Jrock magazines, sans the dyed hair. Ok maybe one of them had dyed hair. Very polite, very friendly. Maybe they just opened, but it seems like a lot of Japanese east villages restaurants are tired of being constantly hounded with long lines and disgruntled diners. No this place was warm. Sapporo beer is served in cute little half portion mugs for all those who can't hold their liquor. Perfect. I loved the tofu, it's delicious salty with the sauce but an even and ""thick"" texture. Fried chicken was delicious and generous in portion sizing. Addictive cabbage was seasoned perfectly. Japanese pasta was exactly as I remembered, light tomato sauce with al dente noodles. Not sure why I haven't been able to find an accurate replication until now. Salmon roe bowl: as expected. It was a special. Pass. Milk pudding. Delicious with the perfect creamy flavor. The two diners next to us wondered out loud why anyone would pay $8 for pudding. More for me. I think the thing that I really appreciated was the service. The waiter was friendly and went out of his way to explain the dishes and their thought process, without us inquiring. The food came fast. The food was ample in portions per price.   Reservations may be needed eventually. The key is that it's authentic. Izakayas are not aimed to give you the foodie experience of bone marrow steamed in bear caviar served over a bed of baby jellyfish. But this restaurant so aptly fits its name and ultimately fulfills its purpose.

It was such a simple item that I almost didn't order it because, how good could just cabbage be? Well after two orders of it I can say it is truly addictive.

On this night, both calls made to the cafe yielded the same result - to just come in and note that the kitchen would be closing early. I take the 2 hour train ride into the city, arrive at Petisco to be told that A. reservations were the only parties being seated & B. the folks eating made reservations days before ... while I stood there and looked around, there was an empty table for 4 with no table settings in one corner and set table for 2 in another. I decided to order dinner to go and not bother asking why we couldn't sit at either of those... while waiting for my to-go order, I felt they were annoyed with my standing there waiting. My family & I frequent this cafe. We're locals and appreciated the addition to the neighborhood ... not sure if management has recently changed or what the actual deal is with reservations at this place but we'll find somewhere else to eat. At minimum, when folks call to ask questions, especially ones like 'can i come in and eat?' make sure the person answering the phone knows what they're talking about.

I thought wrong. You seat yourself, which is fine of course, but the staff behind the counter will aimlessly look at you while you wait for a menu or at least a drink order. I've had a waitress look at me sit down, so instead of dropping a menu and taking a drink order, she goes behind the counter to chat with the cook, cleans off two tables that weren't a priority, and eventually stumbles my way. It's not that the staff is rude in terms of attitude, but if the place is not busy there should be no excuse to have your customers wait 10 minutes for a menu. The only reason I gave it two stars is because the food is faily priced and actually decent. Like said, it's a last resort kinda place. Do yourself a favor and go to Kens across the street!

The oysters were *huge*, probably double size to what I'd get in Sweden, and tasted really salty, fresh and good.

They said 15 minutes. They close at 8 and at 7:20ish when we arrived already had their closed sign lit. Went inside to get our order and to use the gift certificate. Our order came to about $21. They said they don't offer cash back for the left over amounts on gift certificates and claimed they couldn't write the left over amount to be used next time on the certificate. Instead they claimed you could only use the gift certificate one time. This meaning if you spend only $21 on a $35 gift cert, Three Brothers pockets the left over money that the person who purchased the certificate spent. This is not only in poor taste but illegal. Will never give them business again. I ended up buying enough cooler drinks to get at least $33 of the $35 on my gift certificate bc I didn't want them to have the satisfaction of a $14ish dollar profit for providing no service. However, I should have had enough money to buy a whole other meal on a separate occasion. I would never recommend contributing to this type of business model.

I visited Parc for the second, third, and fourth time just this past weekend, when I was up to see Lynch's exhibit at PAFA. In short, it's terrific. Parc is as French a place as I've seen in the states, and believe me I have tried to recreate the Parisian experience ever since I left there in 2008. For starters, the ambiance is surprisingly zen for Philly. Situated on the east side of Rittenhouse Square, it's an inviting place to sit outside. The outdoor heaters made that possible during my October trip for sure.  Inside is beautiful as well, and feels intimate despite being a relatively huge space. The menu is just traditional enough. Favorites for me at dinner are many. The onion soup gratinée and the mushroom soups are not to be missed even if you think you won't have room. Any of the fruits de mer (chilled seafood cocktails) make terrific appetizers and rival, if not best, the options over at Devon next door. I have not had any of their salads, a shame indeed, but a summer trip beckons. As for the mains, beef  bourguignon is everything you think it will be and more. I am not a beef eater, but I couldn't resist this meal. It's delightful and not too much. Espressos here taste European--a relief for mournful travelers. The desserts are... the only flaw in my mind. They're too sweet for my taste and also too sweet to be truly authentic. Ah well. I haven't tried the brunch yet, which seems to be a star of the service. We were greeted with an hour wait on a casual Tuesday last week. Granted, it was the holidays, but I'm going to recommend reservations to all brunch-goers. Dinner wise, it seems possible to fit in sans reservation more easily--but book if your heart is set on it. I took off a star for service. It's not up to par for a variety of reasons.

The venue is decorated with antique mirrors, floors and furniture to give a really cool vintage look.  We requested a window seat and our wish was granted.  Lets start with the complimentary bread which was so fresh and so good.  Ive been told if a restaurant had good bread then it will most likely have good food.  We ordered bloody marys which were thick and very good.  We had escargot and oysters for appetizer which were great. For main dish we had steak and eggs, awesome!  If it was warm outside we would of sat outside enjoying the wine. Ive been here several times and the experience gets better and better.

233651,138184,2034,3.0,1,2015-01-03,"Despite arriving on-time for our reservation, the front of the house let down the back of the house. On the positive side, other than an overly salty Beef Bourguignon, the cooking was well done. Starters including tuna carpaccio, the mushroom tart and the charcuterie plate all received rave reviews (the Salade Verte received only a passing grade), while mains of Skate Grenobloise, Lamb Shank Provencal and Durade Royal en Papilotte were all solid if not particularly memorable. The service, however, was consistently lacking--from not just the server, but ""management,"" which conspicuously avoided stopping by our table despite visiting everyone else within eyesight in the course of two hours. We asked for some more bread of their excellent bread basket, but only received it following a third conversation with ""our"" waitress who unceremoniously dumped it on the table when it finally arrived. As the bottle of wine we'd ordered was finished, the list of wines by the glass was requested, twice, after which the waitress from which we'ed requested it saw fit  to stroll by and ask, oh, did you want the wine list to order by the glass?! And speaking of glasses, water glasses consistently went unfilled (and the coffee was only refilled upon request). Parc can still cook, but no one bothered to ask us about the food, and from our experience, they really didn't care: 4* food plagued by 2* service.

The interior is designed to recall the chic brasseries of Paris, and it is done beautifully. We strolled in around 5PM on a Saturday and were seated immediately. We were told that they were expecting a big crowd around 6PM, but if we thought we could be out in an hour we could be seated right away. That worked out fine for us since we had a train to catch anyway. We were given a nice spot by the window looking out to Rittenhouse Square. They also have some nice outdoor seating. Now, on to the food. Where to begin? We ordered the cheeseburger, cooked medium, and the 1/2 roast chicken. The burger was bursting with flavor and cooked to perfection. How were the fries, you ask? A+. They were simply delicious. The 1/2 roast chicken was some of the best we've had. Flavorful, moist, soft, perfect. What more is there to say? The service was good and the food was delectable. Parc deserves nothing less than five stars and I hope to dine here again soon.

I know about all the hype and rage around this restaurant-- I ran into someone in LA over the summer who had even heard about this restaurant and who pleaded for me to try it out when I got back to campus. However, when I went for the first time this past season I wasn't impressed. At all. Ambiance was cute, but definitely not one of the cutest I've ever seen. Service was a little on the awkward side. And the dish I ordered was mediocre at best-- a poached eggs dish with asparagus. It was rather cold, and the vegetables lacked flavor and the textutre of the egg was a bit questionable as well. Overall, a not-so-great dining experience and so I still don't understand why people swear by it.

The restaurant is very nice on the inside. We were immediately seated and were given a salad to start after we ordered, which had a delicious dressing. We started with the flaming sausage appetizer, which was great. For the main course, my wife and kids had the seafood paella which they all loved (and will be eating as leftovers for the next few days). I took the waiter's recommendation and had the Portuguese steak, which was unreal. We topped everything off with a lava cake for desert. As an entire meal, this was top-notch. If the purpose of Groupon is to introduce you to new places with the hope of becoming a regular customer...mission accomplished. The staff was great, the food was great, no complaints at all.

I don't mind the wait, so much of the grease smell that will be left on your clothes if your in there for more than 10 minutes (which is to be expected). To be clear if you have to wait five minutes to order in my experience its because they are busy helping other customers. PS $1 & $2 fish sandwiches can be grabbed quickly for a snack, but you can't call those in on the phone.

235348,9416,2052,5.0,1,2015-01-04,"Before reading up on Montclair, I had no clue there were any Ethiopian restaurants anywhere in New Jersey within an hour of my home.  It's been about a year since I last had Ethiopian food, so when the time came to choose a dinner spot during my recent visit Mesob won hands down.  It also helped that it was mentioned in a couple online articles I had read about the town. When you walk into Mesob, you feel transported.  You're not on busy Bloomfield avenue.  You're inside a comfortable, warm (and well decorated) zone.  The furniture and seats are all nice wood colors.  The walls have a warm white and orange color combination.  Paintings hang on the walls and in the center host island are tall lambs with (what I was told) a foreign alphabet printed onto them.  The appearance is striking and it immediately draws you in.  The smell of delicious spices and food help too! The staff was super nice.  Every server was fast, efficient and sweet.  They genuinely want to please and they do a great job.  We were seated, our orders taken, water provided and food on the table within a twenty minute stretch.  It helped that we knew what we wanted, but keep in mind some dishes require about 15 minutes to prepare since they're made fresh. All the food is served on Injera bread, a spongy, slightly sour bread served in a round shape on a round platter.  The foods you order are generally scooped on top of this bread when you are served, making for a delicious and dramatic presentation!  So here's the verdict on the food I had with my girlfriend: INJERA BREAD Let's start with the basics.  The Injera bread was soft, spongy and had the slightly sour taste you want with this bread.  This also serves as your ""utensil"" to eat with (you rip pieces off and scoop the food up in it) and it held together perfectly. LEGA TIBS Cubed boneless leg of lamb marinated & sautéed with onions, garlic, jalapenos, fresh tomato, herbs & spices.  This can be spicy, but we had it at ""medium"".  It was very tasty and all the spices were just right, not too heavy, not too light.  A couple of meat chunks were tougher than I would've liked, but that was only a couple and not a majority of them. DORO TIBS Scalloped chicken breast marinated & sautéed with red onions, garlic, jalapeno pepper, fresh tomato, herbs & spices.  We also had this medium, but it wound up coming out a bit spicier than the Lega Tibs, but that was fine by me since I like spicy!  The chicken had a nice texture and tasted wonderful. TIKIL GOMEN (Side) Cabbage and potatoes simmered in mild sauce.  I've had this dish in other restaurants before, and it was generally mild.  This version however was packed with flavor and hit me with an unexpected (but pleasant) punch of flavor.  It was also wonderfully tender. KIK ALETCH (Side) Yellow split peas simmered in a mild and flavorful onion and herb sauce.  This is normally a very mild dish, but this version had a sweetness that I really appreciated given the sea of spicy foods on the platter. GOMEN (Side) Fresh collard green simmered in mild sauce seasoned with spice and herbs.  This had a mild flavor.  The greens had a nice chew and I recommend it as a good palette balancer for all the spicy food you might get. MISIR WAT (Side) Split lentils simmered in spicy hot sauce.  This was a lentil dish with some fire!  It didn't burn but it definitely had a flavor that will wake up your taste buds! Overall I loved my experience at Mesob and look forward to my next trip!

Butcher Bar doesn't have a 'brunch' menu, but we thought we'd give it a go anyway as it was nearing late afternoon and I felt like something filling. When we sat down we ordered some coffee and were shocked to find out they don't actually have it! If I wasn't so hungry I  probably would have moved on to a different restaurant, but I'm glad we ended up staying as we had a relaxing afternoon and good food. I got the 'Crazy Good Turkey Burger' for lunch, with a side of potato salad and a root beer. Everything was delicious, and we all agreed we'd definitely be back. I did return a few weeks later for dinner and have to say that the 'Porky's Platter' is one of the best meals I've had in Astoria. It came with coleslaw and also a free side so we had the potato salad which I'd had previously and recommended to my date. We both agreed that it was delicious and filling - it's $23 but enough for 2 people. We also had some drinks and our bill came out to $53 in total which I think is very reasonable for a night with good food and service. I'm so glad I live nearby as I'll definitely be back soon!

However, this place does offer a break from all that by offering a variety of noodle soups, including wonton, spicy beef noodle, and seafood among others. The noodles and meat/seafood are cooked to order, so expect to wait around ten minutes for it to be ready. When it is, you add your own toppings. The portions are decent for around $7. My spicy beef noodle soup came with five large chunks of beef and plenty of baby bok choy. As for the noodles, they were cooked too long and became soggy/too soft. Great option if it's cold outside or you want something that isn't fried.

And since we were in Rittenhouse area and nowhere near Han Dynasty, we decided to finally check out the great smells emanating from Jane G's. It's a sleek space, with plenty of space at both the bar and in the dining area. Dumpling Sampler [$14] Vegetable, chicken & mushroom, truffle edamame, pork & leek We started off with some dumplings. We had vegetable dumplings which had a nice mix within and was paired with papaya, but the dough was a bit dense. The chicken and mushroom had nice flavor and was paired with cucumber. Paired with some field greens, the truffle edamame had a nicely understated truffle essence, but the real star was the pea puree and the crispy texture of the dumpling. The pork and leek dumpling was fairly standard and came with carrots. Dan Dan Noodles [$7] Can't help but compare the dan dan noodles here to the one's at Han Dynasty. The initial attack of spice was tempered by a nice peanut essence. The noodles were fresh and had great chew. Even better were the abundantly crisp bits of pork. Best version I've had outside of Han Dynasty thus far. Garlic Soy Pork Belly [$8] Do get the pork belly dish here. This was a huge platter of thinly sliced pork in a garlic soy glaze that wasn't overpowering. The heat that comes on the finish was really nice. . Mung bean sprouts were hidden below, which offering a light countervailing element to this ridiculous portion of pork Rock Shrimp [$11] Atop some mixed greens, the rock shrimp were sweet and lightly dressed in a wasabi sauce. The fry on the shrimp could have been crisper though. Three Cup Chicken [$15] On the other end of the spectrum, the three cup chicken is a complete contrast to the version at Han Dynasty. At least half of the dish was littered with bone shards. Should definitely have been advertised as bone-in chicken. The sauce was decent, but not as rich as I would expect. The bits of roasted garlic cloves and ginger were nice though.   While there were a few dishes that didn't speak to me, there's plenty to warrant a return trip to Jane G's. Do get the pork belly and check out the Dan Dan Noodles. For the Rittenhouse area, it's affordably priced as well.

Jane G's mapo tofu (vegetarian) is a delicious dish.  Compared to Han Dynasty, Jane G's spice level is slightly less painful, but all together packed with flavor and heat.  I recommend going all in with a 4-5 spice level.  Initially the $12 price tag seemed a little steep until I saw the portion size.  My mapo tofu was easily stretched into two additional meals (reheated with mung bean noodles, mmmm). My better half sticks to the Sichuan style entrees, fluctuating between the perfume and long hot style dishes.  He has less of a mouth for fire, and sticks with a 2-3 spice level.   Jane G's is great for dining in -- date night or large group outings both work in the spacious interior -- or for delivery when we're feeling lazy.  (While American Express is accepted for dine-in visits, it is not accepted for delivery.)

240227,15151,2640,4.0,1,2015-01-07,"I made a reservation here before Nick Elmi won top chef and unfortunately had to cancel.  Needless to say, the timing could not have been worse, because in the intervening time, he won Top Chef, and I have not been able to get back in since. I've been forced to jog by it every other night on my run and watch people enjoy what was, until last night, beyond my reach. Luckily, last night a series of unfortunate events involving snow, cancellations, and an unexpectedly open evening combined to result in an open table for four at Laurel and an invitation for me from a friend. We arrived on this frigid evening to a warm, welcoming, and intimate BYOB Laurel, armed with several bottles of wine between the four of us.  After everyone arrived, our server explained the options to us.  We could order either a la carte or do the chef's tasting menu for $85.  If we did the tasting menu, the whole table would have to do it.  I am mostly vegetarian at home, but will eat birds of any kind when I'm out to eat, so I was worried my restrictions would keep the table from ordering the tasting menu.  Luckily, Chef Elmi was able to provide a tasting menu with that in mind.  I would suggest that if you have dietary restrictions and you have a reservation further in advance than day of, that you let the restaurant know ahead of time. Dishes: Salt Roasted Beet Salad--I love beets, I love salt, I love pralines.  This dish had them all.  While I forgot about it later on when discussing dishes with my friends at the table, reflecting now reminds me that this dish was superb.  The beets were nicely done with just the right amount of salt to go with their sweet earthiness.  The praline flavor came by way of some kind of foam or sauce and was delicious. Foie Gras and Cocoa Torchon, Radicchio Jam, Gooseberry-Saffron Gelee--I enjoyed this interpretation of this dish.  The cocoa added a bitterness that you could really continue to taste after you took the last bite. Duck Confit Cassoulet--this was my favorite dish of the evening.  There is not a ton of duck confit in the dish, but I still managed to get the flavor in every bite.  The creaminess from the quail egg and the interesting flavor of the onion ash took this dish to the next level.  My only criticism is that the serving was too small, I could have eaten a cereal bowl of this. Fresh Ricotta Gnocchi--this dish came without pancetta for me.  The flavors were wonderful, the gnocchi was surprisingly stark white, and the sourdough breadcrumbs were an interesting addition.  I got a little bit of a lemony flavor--so even though the dish looked to be heavy, it was surprisingly light. Peking Style Duck Breast--this dish came with about four ounces of duck breast cooked a bit closer to medium than medium rare with a peking-style sauce.  It was accompanied by a roasted sunchoke, a sweet sunchoke puree, and coffee crumbles.  The duck was perfectly cooked and tender and the salty fatiness of its skin was delicious with the contrasting sweetness of the sauce and sunchoke puree and the bitterness of the coffee crumbles. For dessert we had the famous white chocolate pudding.  I may never be able to get a reservation again if I say this, but it reminded me of fancy worm pudding.  The decadent, rich, thick pudding was topped with chocolate shavings and sugared gooseberry (taking the place of the gummy worm, I'm sure).  It was well-beyond any worm pudding I was served in girl scouts, and I highly recommend it.  Chef Elmi came out when dinner was served to greet our table, which is a wonderful touch that you don't get at other restaurants. The service was good, but not on the caliber I have experienced at some other restaurants in the same class as Laurel.  Maybe the bad weather meant it was an off night.   Bottom line:  The food is completely worth the wait.

My side dish also had what I think was pancetta, and the texture of it was rubbery.. not good at all.

The hashbrowns were good, but could be a little less salty. That portion was big enough for 2, maybe 3 people- I ended up taking the rest home. And the butter? The butter! It's fantastic. I'm not really sure how they make it, but our waiter said it was cherry vanilla bourbon or something like. I would go there just to eat the bread so I could spread the butter. LOL.

I'm so glad that I did, because this place was freaking awesome! Thankfully I read the reviews that said they accept cash only, so I was prepared to pay for my $9 Paesano sandwich. The place was packed, but I lucked out and was able to snag a table as someone was getting up. I've learned two things about Philly: Always carry cash and places are intimate, so plan ahead and be ready to wait. Not a bad thing.. just different. This sandwich joined together Beef brisket with horseradish mayo, sharp provolone, roasted tomatoes, pepperincino and a fried egg. Everything about this sandwich was delicious.. the beef was tender and juicy and the bread was crunchy in all the right places. Seriously one of the top 5 I've had in quite some time. I've already decided that when I go back, I'm trying the Bolognese. Who can go wrong with a sandwich that is described as Crispy Fried Lasagna Bolognese, Smoked Parmesan, Fried Egg? Another item of note: the fountain drinks aren't what you expect. Diet Rite was the only diet option that had and the other soda choices aren't your normal everyday options. I get the feeling this is more of a water drinking place, and I think I was about the only person who went to the fountain machine while I was there. To those who suggested Paesano's to me, I tip my hat and thank you for sharing this lovely gem with me. I couldn't have imagined a better lunch!

On one hand, I love that the funky decor and lighting give the place an authentic feel. The service is very friendly as well. I've had the same waitress every time I've been here, and she does an excellent job of remembering repeat customers. She even gave my friend and I complimentary glasses of wine the last time I was here! Very sweet of her. Although the presentation isn't the prettiest, the gnocchi here is some of the best I've had in terms of melt-in-your-mouth texture. However, I think the prices are a bit steep for a neighborhood spot like Cucina Forte. The last time I was here, my friend and I split a salad, an appetizer, and 2 gnocchi entrees and ended up paying 40$ each! We searched the receipt for contributing factors to this surprisingly high price and discovered that the buffalo mozzarella appetizer we split was 15$. The quality of the cheese, olives, and sundried tomatoes on the plate didn't really live up to that price, unfortunately. Still, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a BYOB dinner spot near the Italian Market, I'd just advise them to ask about the prices for the specials before ordering.

That and the fact that though they are small plates, you fill up faster than you think you will, and if you are like me are left with almost a full order of the pork belly staring at you.   The service was nice, and attentive, but without hovering.  The food came out much quicker than I could have expected.   Drinks - sangria for me were wonderful, and tasty, and strong. A+ I will continue to dream about the aged manchego w/ truffled lavender honey, the stuffed dates, the spicy potatoes, the beef short rib flat bread, and the pork belly.  I can not say I tasted one thing I didn't love all night.   All in all this is clearly one of the shining stars in Philly and for good reason.  I wouldn't miss it!!

Based on the yelp reviews, I ordered: the grilled asparagus with poached egg, truffle and Mahon crisp; short rib flatbread, crab stuffed peppers, bacalao fritters. We also tried the lamb merguez flatbread, filet mignon with foie, trout, lechon, Spanish octopus, chickpeas and spinach, bacon wrapped dates and more. Yes we ordered a lot. I will say that my yelp people led me the wrong way. I thought the lamb flatbread was far better than the short rib flatbread. Crab stuffed peppers had a lot of crab but were not particularly flavorful. Asparagus was cooked perfectly  but not much truffle flavor. I liked the octopus quite a bit and also The bacalao. Loved the filet with foie gras. Bacon wrapped dates are always good. The fish was just okay. The lechon was awesome and I would definitely want to come back to try the whole suckling pig to see if it is the best thing I ever ate. The ambience was bustling noise level moderate. Dress casual/smart. Lots of candles. Would definitely come back but I would like to check out some other places in Philly first.

Prior to the surprise the number of people attending changed. From what I understand Amada management was pretty reasonable and accommodating with that. Karey was just unreasonably rude to all of us and treated us like an inconvenience.  We had a set menu and ordered pitchers on sangria (and two separate mixed drinks), so we did not have difficult orders or requests. At one point a glass was broken and she did bring a new one, nor did she take the old broken one away for at least 30 min...our friend just had to drink out of a broken glass.  We also did not get checked on, asked about additional drinks (we wanted to order more sangria), or even more water... Also, one of the servers came out with a dish for a friend who was pregnant (and had not really made this information public, she just quietly asked about a dish), and asked ""who is the pregnant person at the table"". Pretty unprofessional. At the end of our meal she lost 2-3 of the signed receipts (one was mine) and she made us come back in to sign... I was really looking forward to trying Amada because it is/was my friends (birthday girl's) favorite place, and we were considering using them as the catering company for our wedding next summer...thank god we didn't commit to that venue yet! If the service is this bad with 13 people and a fixed course menu, I can't imagine how terrible it would be with 150+ people! The food was good, but the service from this waitress was just so bad that it made me not want to return.

The significance of my visit is great-This is the first meal I've ever had on the East Coast. I'm happy to say it was at Amada. I came to Amada for lunch. Located in Old City, one can walk the cobblestone paths to Amada and have lunch at Amada. Amada takes reservations on Open Table. When you walk in, you are greeted by the hostess and seated.  On my visit, I was seated between a group of older women celebrating a birthday and a group of young professionals on a business lunch. All in all, Amada caters to every taste and walk of life. Amada takes pride in the food they serve-presentation and taste are both priorities. With each course, my server explained what the ingredients and technique were for the dish. From the croutons on the soup to the papas fritas, I could tell the food was made with great care and attention to detail. For lunch, I had the ajo blanco soup (parsnip and almond base, brioche crouton) and hanger steak pepito. The hanger steak pepito would have made my best friend from Omaha smile. That steak was done well. The caramelized onions and the freshness of the tomato complemented the steak. The bread was soft, yet did not absorb the juices from the meat. The spicy potatoes (a la papas fritas at Aventura, Ann Arbor) were a hit with me. I devoured these first-perfectly fried, golden potatoes, drizzled in a cheese sauce that would make any Cheez Whiz-phobic person rethink their phobia of processed cheese.   Overall, 5 stars for service and 5 stars for the food.

As for decor, the place is lightly dimmed and it has a nice and cozy feel. Now on to the food. For appetizer, we had the bone marrow with toast, sea prawns with mash and poached egg, and shrimp croquettes with sea prawns. My favorite is the bone marrow. Adding the salt makes a big difference. It helps to enhance the flavor of the bone marrow to another level. The other two appetizers were good too. They were on the lighter side. The mash was light and creamy. The croquette was crispy on the outside and mushy on the inside. For entrees, we shared the steak tartare, thailandaise and marinieres mussels. Every entree came with a basket of fries and mayo on the side. The fries were nice and crispy. I know fries are filling so I purposely saved them for after I was done with the entree to munch on them. As for the mussels, they're plump and medium size. My favorite is the thailandaise mussels. Curry with the mussels seafood flavor was amazing. Even after we finished with the mussels, the bus boy asked a few times if it's ok to take the pot away. Of course I said no because I was using it to dip bread and drink the soup. The steak tartare was good too. Mix it with the egg and the sides of herbs it comes with. It definitely enhances the flavor. The olives and pickles on the side compliments the steak tartare really well. My least favorite was the marnieres mussels. I thought it was too salty for my taste. For dessert, we got the belgian tiramisu. Even though we were full, we still had to try it. It was delicious!  It was light and creamy. It was a good ending to our meal. We found out there they have all you can eat mussels for $24 on Sundays and Mondays. Will definitely be back to try the other mussels.

I was looking forward to this place, not for their waffles, but because I was craving for eggs benedict. Once I got here though, the eggs benedict wasn't on the menu and it turns out they don't serve it on the weekdays. I was already craving for something savory and I was expecting something savory, but I decided to try one of their waffles since they were popular for them. I ordered the banana split waffle, which has banana, vanilla ice cream, chocolate syrup and whipped cream. My boyfriend ordered the mac&cheese. I didn't particularly enjoy the waffle. It didn't taste special or anything amazing. It was just okay. It was really crispy and it didn't really leave room for much fluffiness inside. Honestly, I prefer waffles and dinges to this. I couldn't finish it, because I didn't enjoy it, and also I was still craving for something savory so I didn't really feel like eating sweets. However, the mac & cheese was good. I've had better though. If I were to come here again, I wouldn't order the mac & cheese. This place is quite small and the music they played reminded me of France somehow.

NEVER had anything like that before. The boursin cheese was so fresh and just made the dish. I absolutely recommend it. It's a perfect brunch meal.

All of the servers and management were extremely accommodating and took really good care of us.

After wandering around lower manhattan we were thirsting for a bar with a good beer selection and a great atmosphere. The Malt House was the perfect fit! DRINKS - Amazing craft beer list, probably the best one in the area. They also have their own house brew which was an added plus. -Prices are reasonable - I noticed there were different happy hour specials such as $5 house wine and $4 drafts. -One cool note - the beer was served in mason jars which added to the overall experience. ATMOSPHERE -Very cosy. Roger the bartender was also really nice. When he checked my ID he noticed it was my birthday so he gave me a free drink! -The bar itself is really big. There was also a separate room away from the bar with more tables. OVERALL - Great find in Greenwich village. Its exactly the kind of bar we were looking for - great drinks in a warm and cosy atmosphere! Next time I'm in NYC I'll definitely be stopping by!

253564,146523,2191,1.0,1,2015-01-01,"Having read good things about it, and for many years wanting to try it, a friend and I went to Jimmy Buff's for lunch at about 11:30 a.m. before New Year's Eve. Upon entering the somewhat rundown looking building, we found ourselves not only in the ordering line, but also cramped in the very narrow aisle that exists between the counter and the exterior windows. (There is only enough room for another person to squeeze by if they went sideways). There are a few tables in the cramped space inside the building. A bunch of folks made use of the area and ate. We each made our order for an Italian Hot Dog, then waited in line for about 10 minutes for the short order cook to prepare the order after completing the orders of people in front of us.   While waiting, my friend note a hand writing sign (about 5 inches by 7 inches) taped to the counter stating that the business operated on a Cash Only basis and an ATM machine was located outside of the business. Not only did we not have cash and needed to go to the ATM and pay the $2 ATM fee, but we were left with an immediate bad taste in our mouths (pun intended). In my opinion, any legitimate business that is cash only is suspect in my mind and my opinion is that the business doesn't care about its customers. I understand the desire for a business to minimize its costs and maximize its profit. One way is not having to pay a 2-3% transaction fee for each credit card purchase it has. But the reality is the merchants simply tack the fee on to its retail price to the customer (although they hide it as a cost-of-goods expense, since the credit card companies do not allow the fee to be passed on, officially). Any business not accepting cash, in my opinion, does the following: 1) Adds an unnecessary burden on the customer for having to get cash and pay a $2 fee (far more than the 2-3% the merchant would pay if they accepted the credit card and passed along the fee to the consumer); 2) Prevents the budget conscious or business expense tracking customer from having a receipt for the purchase to keep track of their expenses; and most importantly, 3) Makes it very difficult, if not impossible, for an auditor, the IRS or a law enforcement agency from knowing exactly how much cash came into a business, thus that simple complication leaves open a potential for a business to underreport its income and leave itself open to corruption. I'm not saying this is what is going on at Jimmy Buff's, since it has been in business for decades and has a good reputation, but the potential for a business not taking cash is there, regardless. Obviously, Jimmy Buff's policy of not accepting credit cards ticked me off and cost me $2 more for my food than I planned to spend. Strike One! Strike Two - The short order cook wore a plastic glove on his left hand and no glove at all on his right hand. The purpose of the gloved hand is to keep the food sanitary and not transfer germs and bacteria to the food and make a person sick. Yet, he routinely used the gloved hand to open and close the refrigerator that was behind him on his left side, to get the uncooked, unwrapped, single hot dogs, sausage and other items and place them in the fryer in front of him. He used the ungloved hand to take the onions, peppers and potato slices from the counter behind him and into the fryer's oil. (A female in the back of the store cut them, put them in the bowl and placed the bowl on the counter). He also used the gloved hand to touch the cooking utensils, countertop and anything else he needed to. So much for proper sanitation/foodborne illness prevention! As the cook prepared my sandwich, I asked for extra onions and peppers as he put a sparse amount on it to start with and I asked for my potatoes to be well done. What I received was a charge for the extra veggies (one fork full more than the fork full he originally put on) and undercooked potatoes. Plus, the hot dogs were not crisp (did not snap when bitten) as they should when fried or cooked properly for an Italian Hot Dog sandwich. Strike Three (and maybe more)! Since I took the sandwich to go, I discovered the issues while on the highway and heading out of the area. As a result, I was unable to eat the food, but just picked at the onions and peppers. Enough of my opinion, here are a few from my friend: The onions and peppers were greasy. Hot dogs were undercooked and salty. The bread was too air blown, adding volume, but not taste. My opinion - Save the trip. Save the $2 cash ATM fee. If you want a real (and good) Italian Hot Dog, do as I have been doing for many decades - go to Dickie Dees on Bloomfield Ave. in Newark. (At one time Jimmy Buff's had another location in the vicinity, but not actually in Newark that competed with Dickie Dees, but that has closed some time ago). Dickie Dees is much larger, has great Italian Hot Dogs and is real close to the best Italian Bake Shop in the area - Calandra's.

I also got a small container of potato salad.  Pricing was typical about ten dollars for both times.   To my surprise and dismay my chicken cutlet sandwich was less than satisfactory.  The chicken was dry and the mayo tasted off.  The best part of the sandwich was the bread.  The potato salad was bland and not very appetizing.  It was a real bummer considering the reviews.   Perhaps they just had a bad day?  Nevertheless I can't give M.F.C.  more than a two star rating based on my experience and I can't see myself returning to give them another try.

It was decently busy but not crazy busy. The bartender/waitress walked right passed me about 5 times looked at me and didn't even acknowledge me. She did however manage to find time to talk to the two guys next to me about the next concert that she's going to and about some other less known bands. Once my bf showed up about 10min later, she actually came over and asked us if we wanted anything to drink. From then on it went fairly smooth and the food is actually really good. Just very unimpressed with the service. Apparently I needed a beard and a penis to be able to get her attention.

After some research, I found that Sloane is a renowned tea brand in Canada that is only offered at Maman and Payard's in NYC. One compliant would be that the place is a bit stuffy and the open kitchen makes the whole cafe a bit smokey (this is especially bad in the winter when they keep the front door closed and there is limited air circulation).

We sat in the catering hall in the cold room with our coats on, there were several people who were waiting ahead of us and also people who came in 10 or 20 minutes after us. After waiting for an hour or more, I noticed that some of the people that had come in after us, we're being seated ahead of us (2 people parties).

When I pointed that out to him, he was very apologetic and we were seated next. While walking us over to the restaurant, the host explained that he had seen my date's name but kept forgetting to announce it, because the other host had written his name on the back of a page, rather than on the next page.

But the reason I am writing this review- and actually made a yelp account, is the chicken. That chicken was the most delicious, crunchy, juicy, tender, mouth watering thing I've ever eaten. Any other fried chicken is nothing compared to this spectacular chicken. Words cannot describe how much I am already craving that chicken even though I went there TODAY. Their waffles are just as great. The soft warm Belgian waffle underneath that flawless piece of meat was perfect. The flavor combination of the two foods was phenomenal. I've never experienced something so amazing before in my existence. I don't think I've ever been this emotionally impacted or inspired by a plate of food this much until I went to Amy Ruth's. This food really does speak to your soul. However, on a more serious matter, the service was pretty slow. Our waitress seated us, walked away, gave us menus, walked away again (not even speaking yet may i add) comes back with the cornbread&waters, LEAVES AGAIN, then finally about 10 mins after being seated she introduced herself. The food came in about 5-10 mins which was good, but when we finished, we waited for about 15 mins for the check and 30 mins for her just to come back and take the check. I dont know what took her so long but it made us very angry at our table. Some stuff was a little pricey (sides dont come with meals and cost 4.50 for little things like corn..) but I'm not really complaining because it was so delicious. Except the chicken and waffles cost a dollar extra and they never changed it in the menu- It was in the check. Even though thats not a big difference, they should update the menus so its not confusing. I am very happy with my trip to Amy Ruth's and will definitely return!!!!!

We had fried chicken and jerk chicken, which both had amazing skin texture and moist chicken taste, fried chicken with white meat and it still turned out so deliciously moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. The flavoring of jerk chicken is memorably spicy. The fried okra wasn't a mushy mess nor too greasy, one of my favorite okra dishes. The collard greens wasn't too bitter, greasy, or sweet. The Mac and cheese looked simple but still delicious, and I also usually don't like getting Mac and cheese at places especially if they taste like my mediocre grocery version I can make. Last was cheese grits, pretty good, but I've never had before. We came at 1pm, there was a 2pm rush on a Saturday

263433,24522,2265,4.0,1,2015-01-06,"Reading the other Yelp reviews may have spoiled my first impression of this place--I admit I had my expectations a *wee* bit high coming in for brunch one weekend morning. I, however, was not disappointed even if not completely blown away and would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking to dabble in a Southern styled brunch for the morning. This is a very popular spot located in Williamsburg not far from public transportation and while I did not have to experience a wait, many of the parties coming in did however end up waiting for a good 15-20 minutes. No reservations, so plan your trip wisely and my first recommendation would be to arrive as early as you can! Restaurant is a little tight, but they do have a back dining area and it can hold a decent number of parties. There's larger and smaller sections in the restaurant. I also have to note that I loved the music they were playing here... Onto the important stuff, Service was very rush and go given the volume and demand from the restaurant, but they were friendly and I had no issues with them. There was a quip with the credit machine at the end of my visit and we had to wait a good 10 minutes additional for the cheque, but they apologized and let us know timely. Food is really great. I highly recommend the chicken biscuit--moreso than any of the other options on the menu (given I haven't tried everything). You'll get your hands a little messy, but it's damn tasty and worth a try. I also sampled the fried chicken & waffles, biscuits, the chocolate cake donut and the sweet tea. I found all of the options pretty tasty. I wasn't blown away by the fried chicken (little dry, tasted run of the mill) and definitely have had better, but the biscuits were scrumptious and the chocolate cake donut was very filling! Sweet tea was a smidge bland--when I think sweet tea, I want it as sweet as sweet can be. Waffles were mega tasty and I loved 'em. So, tl;dr version of the food-- waffles and chicken biscuit were a total hit in my book. Get those when you come here. Try out the donuts too. I didn't get to try the pies--will come back and definitely add my two cents on those also!

There are more seating way inside when you enter the place, so yay. We got the Chicken & Waffles, Rob Evans, and Scramble from the Brunch menu. Chicken & Waffles: 2 pieces of fried chicken with buckwheat waffles, topped with cinnamon butter and maple cranberries. The chicken were lightly fried to perfection, there were enough spices and seasoning to make the chicken tasty, and bonus, the meat wasn't dry and bland either. It was cooked well. However, personally, I'm not  fan of buckwheat waffles so that was a miss for me. I even put maple syrup on it, couldn't bear to finish the rest of the waffles. It tasted way too bland/cardboard for my personal preference. Rob Evans: homemade sausage gravy, egg and cheese on a biscuit. So yummy, the combination of the biscuit with the sausage gravy was absolutely delicious. This hands down was the best dish of the meal. The gravy wasn't too salty or heavy, it was seasoned and cooked just right. Paired with the warm and lightly toasted biscuit, made it a favorite of the meal. Scramble: Scramble eggs with brussel sprouts, carmelized onions, and sour cream. Comes with a biscuit and a side, which we got home fries. The sour cream definitely added some extra taste to the eggs. It was not something I imagined to be paired with eggs, but it worked perfectly. It was a unique taste, and the carmelized onions also made the eggs taste good. The home fries were all right, and then the biscuit again, well done. For dessert, we couldn't get more than one slice of pie, so we settled on the classic apple pie. First off, pies are meant to be eaten warm, so the fact they asked if we wanted it to be heated up was a bonus. Apple pies, you really can't go wrong, so I was looking forward to seeing what they do differently with this classic. First off, the crust was wonderful, it was light, flaky, and not too overbearing. The filling was also done well, not too much cinnamon and tartness from the apples. Topped with whip cream, so goddamn good. Overall, a good experience. Will definitely be coming back again when I'm in the neighborhood.

Cull & Pistol was my number one go to HH oyster place, but this place has now taken the spot. Despite the fact that they only let you choose 3 varieties versus more at Cull & Pistol, the oysters were so meaty and the hot sauce was this this special slightly sweet habanero sauce. Not only that, but the service was great. Good music, good vibes all around... Even fellow customers at the bar seemed happy and it was infectious. It was so good that when you exclaimed how good it was, random customers nodded in agreement. Okay, let me not hype it up too much... Only thing was that I thought the crab cake was okay. They used a sweet chili sauce for the spinach, but I feel like it should be something lighter (maybe a light citrus dressing). Also, the fact that I'm Thai and recognized that sauce right away. Usually, we pair that sauce with sliced cucumbers and it works better that way. The crab cake itself tasted like a hybrid of cornbread and crab cake. If you don't mind a sweetened crab cake, you may enjoy this. Wasn't too fond of it though. However, it had a nice crispy exterior. In the end, they give you a free whiskey cake slice. It's actually realllllly good. It tastes kind of like a pound cake, but with a slight whiskey finish in the end. Wasn't like a bad whiskey either. Had no rough bite at the end and was just smooth and yummy. We were told that they make it fresh everyday too. I'll be back again with an emptier stomach :).

I ended up ordering the GoldBurger with hand cut fries which another customer suggested I should get and he was right they were the best. Everything was cooked perfect and on my table in a short time after ordering. The staff member (could have been the owner) asked how i found GoldBurger and as soon as I said Yelp the couple sitting behind me chimed in with the same reason they were there. So to everyone Yelp works. So if your within the Newington area make sure you swing in and try out one of there great Burgers or Dogs. Be sure to get the Hand cut fries.

She was already familiar with Goldburgers and after hearing her talk about it and read the many reviews here and on various other places I was very curious when I finally had a chance to try the burgers myself this past November (I know it's a tad late to write a review, but you know, people forget things). Now, I have to be brutally honest and say these are the best burgers I've had to date (Sorry Uncle Babe's in Gent and Byron in London). Not just because of the fact that the meat is very flavourful or the fact that you taste the the fact that the burgers are grilled. I also really enjoyed the fact that you can customise it to no end and the staff is more than happy to accomodate that (plus I also got a piece of their home smoked bacon and it was gooood) and the daily specials which are always creative. At this point I should also mention the onion rings (another rarity in Belgium). Much like the burgers, they are the best ones I've had to date. Especially when dipped in the apple cider grain mustard, they tasted really good (I like my mustard strong too, so that was nice for me as well). I miss you guys, and I promise I will be back next time I am in the US (right after my flight lands in Hartford).

Even my date, who was skeptical about the potential deliciousness of tofu, was won over. I also got the vegetable cham dubu, medium spicy ($13.95). Comes piping hot in a stone bowl but isn't as fiery as the soon dubu I'm used to. Still, the broth had great flavor and was packed with lots of tofu and zucchini. Perfect for a chilly evening.

273093,154278,2345,5.0,1,2015-01-03,"I recently went to papas pizza after nearly 10 years. After recently moving back to the east coast my family reached our destination of a new restaurant that has an above average vibe on the outside than the previous joint. Who remembers papas old spot in trenton? If you don't then you're not worthy of giving this place any bad reviews. First things first. I greatly dislike crowded places and I make it a lifetime goal to avoid crowds. I would've taken the pizza to go through the side door but I was with a group and out voted 3-1. So, new spot and classy vibe. It's no Olive Garden but who cares about some tour of Italy. This was real Italy here but that didn't help me maintain my nerves. I was nervous and trenching in sweat while rockin my ugly Xmas sweater underneath a brown leather jacket that I was too nervous to take off. My attire was ready for a snow storm but either way my group stood out like a sore thumb. I couldn't help but notice that the spot felt a little crammed. The service was slightly slow but come on. It's a family business not a franchise and the place was at max occupancy with a couple groups leaving and more lingering around to be seated. After a few minutes we received our drinks and homemade group salad. I vividly remember the yams and the moderate salad that had my mind pacing. I was anxious for the pizza and my stomach was roaring like a lion. I'm hungry and the salad wasn't going to do. My mind was second guessing even entering this place. I looked around and my group were just as anxious for the next thing to come. It took a few minutes but then the music changed and classical italian music was in effect. All of suddenly the place seemed to get dark and it felt like heavens light fell upon uour table as the waitress with a slight unnoticeable attitude brought the pizza and placed it on the holy grail on our table. Then a slight war broke out as my group of barbarians were fighting for the pizza as if it was the last piece food for the winter. English escaped our minds as were speaking caveman talk to figure out who'll get the slice with the most sauce. But nothing could explain what happened next. I received my slice of pizza and humanity entered my soul as I realized that this has to be eaten with love and joy. Again the room went dark and I was already halfway between the pizza and my mouth. I never felt this was before about pizza since I last binged on papas nearly a decade ago. All the butterflies in my stomach were gone and the lights were brazing on my head as if I was on stage in front of millions. As soon as I went in for the first bite the room went completely empty. Never in my life had I felt this way. I was actually enjoying food in a crowded place without even realizing the crowd around me. Could it be possible that papas helped me with a fear I never wanted to acknowledge? Hold up, this has to be a joke or so I thought. I was done with my first slice and hastily went for a second. This second one would prove that all of this was a lie. Behold, life again disappeared from any visual existence and only thing around was my second slice and the music. Is this really happening? I entered a state of nirvana but then it was over when I came crashing back to earth. Who am I? Was a question that pondered my mind as I was looking around for a third slice. I quickly clenched a fork in my hand as my animal instincts were pounding through my chest thinking of ways to eliminate the members of my group by means of survival of the fittest. All of this for the last slice of pizza...I couldn't help to notice the others were also clenching their forks in the same manner. We quickly came back to humanity and made the choice to order another large pizza. However, our animal instincts quickly kicked back in as we were howling and growling while trying to get the waitress back to our table. We waited then waited some more until we got the second pizza to go. We tipped the waitress a fair sum of money but not a normal big tip since we felt that it was her fault for depriving us of such godly food. Then we charged out of the door as if we were participating in The Running of the Bulls and the rest was history. Dela who, papa what, domi nooo? The point is that pizza is pizza. It's an art that should be appreciated for its style. I've had pizza all over and even in northern Italy from a shack stand on a dirt road. Some will like pizza cheesy or extra sauce, crispy or undercooked, meat or just a tomato pie, Chicago pizza, BBQ pizza, california pizza and even mexican pizza. There's no such thing as the best pizza but appreciating art at its finest is priceless and this pizza is priceless.

Though our reservation was for 7:00 PM, we arrived about 20 minutes early, checked in our coats/bags, and were promptly seated. The restaurant was not even half full, and I found it amusing that they pulled out the table for better access to the booths (not that we had any trouble at all doing so normally). We settled for the $97 four course prix-fixe, since we weren't especially hungry but still wanted to try more dishes. At my request, the waiter described his recommendations flawlessly, describe the flavors and ingredients of each dish. He also served a complimentary taster of some sort of creme fraiche with a balsamic reduction, and a choice of bread (we liked the kalamata olive) with butter and rosemary salt, and olive oil. Per Cominciare I ordered ""Curdo di Passera,"" which was a fresh, raw, white fish covered in sturgeon caviar and a lemon juice to balance the flavors. Boyfriend had ""Torchon,"" since it had his beloved foie gras. All the elements of torchon combined made for such a full and satisfying taste, which could not be satisfied by eating each ingredient separately. Pasta E Risotto I ordered ""Trofie Nero,"" since I had to see why it was by far the most frequently mentioned dish here. Squid ink has a slightly salty taste, and complimented the bits of seafood well. However, I didn't find it as life-changing as many of the reviews stated. Boyfriend had ""Corzetti,"" which had a very traditional Italian flavor. It had sausage, ricotta, and a wonderful tomato and basil sauce. Pesce Boyfriend ordered ""Astice."" The lobster was so perfectly tender, that we now believe all the other lobster we've had before have been woefully overcooked. Our only gripe was that the portion was half the size of my protein dish. Carne I ordered ""Agnello."" My first thought was that the red wine sauce smelled overpowering and tickled my nose. Yet, I was pleasantly surprised, and soon relished in medium rare lamb that was hardly gamey. One slice of chanterelle tasted oddly woody, and I don't think the lemon juice over the vegetables were necessary. But overall, this was an outstanding meat dish. Dolci I ordered a ""Semifreddo,"" which featured a mandarin mousse, a citrus-y sorbetto, the tiniest assortment of citrus fruits, and a white chocolate twist. I savored each tangy, fruity bite. While I do not typically like white chocolate, the twist was light and not too sweet. Boyfriend asked our third waiter for a non-chocolate-heavy recommendation from the waiter, who then proceeded to point out his favorite 3 chocolate dishes. In the end, he ordered the Tartaletta anyway. Service Our first waiter was fantastic, but throughout our dinner, we had a second, and even a third waiter. None introduced themselves, and the latter two were not as efficient in clearing our plates promptly. The restaurant was not at capacity, nor did we see the waiters occupied at all times, so there was no excuse. My boyfriend even heard one waiter sniff each time he passed our table (perhaps he needed a tissue to wipe away his snootiness?). As we left, the girl who brought our checked-in items was stone-faced. Maybe she suffered from RBF, but her blasé demeanor was not appreciated. Not to mention the group of servers giggling to themselves at the cash register and sneaking glances over at us exhibited unprofessional behavior at a ""high-class"" restaurant. TLDR: Our food was exceptional; the service was not.

Definitely try it out.  When I'm in the area, I end up there at least once.

We ordered fried rice, haemul pajeon, etc. things like that and then the massive seafood hotpot.  We had six people and they said the seafood hotpot feeds six people.  This sucker could probably feed like 9999 people because not only is it a massive pot full of alive, but slowly dying seafood, but it's also preceded by a serving of live octopus sashimi. To be fair, I don't really like seafood, but my father does.  He likes clams.  Holy crap he ate like every clam in there and was stuffed.  My friends and I were all basically dying afterwards because we were so stuffed.

I heard that the weekends are super busy so I guess we went there at the right time. It's not a big place but really cozy. As soon as you walk in, you can smell this delicious seafood. We ordered a small shellfish hot pot and it was HUGE! Shellfish full of hot pot and also the clam itself was huge! Very satisfying. We were two of us but it's good for 3 people. You get to eat so much shellfish and you almost get bored at the end lol Well it's a good thing though. Some of the clams were too chewy and got in our teeth. We also wanted to order live octopus but sadly they didn't have it at that time. Overall, it was a really fun experience and I'll recommend to people. My advice is to share the small pot with 3 people and go there on weekdays. They play electronic music which I like, and the volume was perfect that it wasn't too loud. I hate when I need to shout because the music is too loud. But I heard that they play music louder on the weekends to the point that you need to shout. So keep that in mind ;)

Service was quick.  There were only a couple people in the restaurant when I arrived, so the order went quick.   I ordered the Bibimbap (which is basically their entire menu) with white rice, spicy chicken and a ton of different veggies.  I topped it off with a ""hot paste"".  Although I love spicy food, I have to admit, the spicy chicken with the hot paste was a little too much.  The hot flavor overwhelmed all the veggies and rice.  The meal was good, but certainly not 5 stars.   I plan on trying Pick and Mix a few more times with different combos (beef, teriyaki sauce, etc.).  I'm hoping that something with a little less spice will taste a little better.

The place is small, but that's only because she's been open for only about a year. The owner was incredibly friendly without being prying. I ordered myself a chocoberry shake with strawberries and a coffee for my partner. She had to run a new pot of coffee, but it was worth it as the coffee was wonderful. My milkshake also took a good 5-7 minutes, but she was letting me know why as she was making it. She pays careful attention to major allergies, making sure the chocolate she was using was ok for having hazelnut in it. The shake was thinner than I'm used to, but it had a WONDERFUL, balanced flavor. She used frozen strawberries which really made a world of difference from strawberry syrup -based shakes. My only regret is being too full from my sandwich to order crepes. I would go back in a heartbeat to try them were I coming back to Philly anytime soon. Again, this isn't a quick in-n-out place. But, the owner really cares about making and serving quality food with quality ingredients and, for me, she delivered. Be very wary about negative reviews.

281540,38802,2440,4.0,1,2015-01-05,"Okay you guys.... I was at a tug of war on the amount of stars this place deserves but after much thought I feel the 4th star is rightfully deserved. Here's the scoop: I foolishly thought I could pull a party of 6 with no reservations on a Saturday night at the prime time of 7pm (in my defense it was snowing and raining all day who'da thought I wasn't the only fiend tryna get my fancy grub on) My total wait time for a table was a whopping 3 hours and although I may have a flair for the dramatics this is no tall tale, this is real life home slice. I literally waited 3 hours to be seated. So be warned you last minute yelpers who tryna gauge the severity of not having a reservation and just showing up: The gauge is real--- real upsetting when your hungry! I was upset that I was waiting so long and thought about what I would do if a customer of mine was waiting this long to be seated and thought, well damn I'd at least get them a free drink and voila with a Yelp check in you get just that. Check! Then whenever I kept approaching the host stand to get updates I always felt assured that they were taking care of me, giving me the update on the table (i.e. their on dessert, they're getting the check.. etc) I mean even if it was all BS the dude was so empathetic and personable it was hard to be mad. Another check for the quality of host. After what seemed like a millennium of waiting when we were finally seated it took a moment for the waitress to come over but once she checked in with us she made sure to stay in constant contact with us, she was engaging and efficient. Check again for good waitstaff! The food was simply great, seriously no need for a lengthy description-- it was delicious! Get the picture? Another check mark! Last but not least when we were waiting for valet to pull up our cars the guy that accepted the keys/tickets from you was such a nice guy! I had to wait a bit for the car and in my time standing by him he made sure to greet and say goodbye to each patron-- offering funny jokes and keeping those who were waiting informed on wait time. Can you say CHECK, CHECK, CHECK AND CHECK? It's hard to be mad at this place, I kinda felt like that Rhianna Meme where she's got this crazy satisfied look on her face and the caption reads, ""When you throwing random mood swings at your man but he's handling them really well"" That was totally me, and my boyfriend was Blend on the Water totally handing my mood swings well...

We had the car with us so we opted to get valet parking and when we arrive it took about 10 minutes for anyone to come to the car, one of us had to go inside and ask where the valet is. finally a valet shows up, sticks his hand out to my cousin and starts yelling out ""it's $7!! $7!!"" (in my experience you usually pay AFTER) taken aback, my cousin pays him $7 and the guy speeds away with the car. We walk in, the hostess was a bit rude, but it was expected since the place put off that vibe. She immediately let's us know we need a reservation to be seated, yes, we had one. then tells us our table isn't ready. So we decide to just go to the bar and wait. The bartender tells us their specialty drink is their margarita, so we order it. It was terrible.  the sweetest tasting margarita I've ever had. it tasted like they bought a bunch of mix from duane reade and just added a splash of tequila. It was sooooo loaded with sugar. After the drinks, we decided to not have dinner there just because the vibe was too much, all the employees all acted like they were better than everyone. Again, the view is AAAAAAMMMMMAAAZING! We decided we will probably try this place out again in the summer, because we feel like they do outdoor seating.

Check in on Yelp, get a free sangria. Done. Brunch/Blunch drinks were five bucks. Very reasonable for a slammin Bellini, a perhaps overly citrusy and tame Bloody Mary, and all draft beer (including the Flower Power IPA- a steal at that price). Guac was on point; chips legit. The entrees were things of beauty. My girlfriend got the shrimp mofongo- which, while a small portion, was authentic and well-executed, especially with regard to the garlic sauce. My ""mariscos con arroz"" was a veritable cornucopia of maritime delights. Succulent lobster claws, clams, mussels, and scallops on a bed of flavorful rice.

The big draw about Blend on the Water is quite obviously the stunning views of the Manhattan skyline and the East River.

I feel like most of the time when I order steak and eggs, the steak always ends up coming out well done instead of medium. They were on the money here with the perfect amount of pink in the churrasco. The arroz con mariscos contained a ton of seafood, and the pulled pork eggs benedict arepas are easily my favorite. The yolky goodness from the egg bleeding onto the pulled pork and mixing with its juices onto the crispy arepa underneath is a palette-pleaser. I came here on a random Wednesday night and the special was a $15 pitcher of sangria. It's a hefty size and has to be finished by at least 2 people.

The staff is fantastic.  True Italian hospitality, from the moment you walk in.  The host came over and chatted with us for a bit (I speak a bit of Italian, so it's always fun to practice).  After a few minutes, they came over with fresh parmesan cheese and fresh imported Italian olives, which were delicious!  They also brought some complimentary bruschetta, and fried zucchini, and both were fantastic and tasty! The menu was fantastic.  There was everything from authentic Italian and Sicilian specialties to Americanized food like Chicken Parmesan, all of it seemed fresh and tasty.  We started with a mixed green salad split (they split it in the kitchen, which I love).  The salad tasted like it was freshly harvested.  :)  Very good. For main courses, being the creature of habit that I am, I had Spaghetti with arrabbiata sauce, and my wife ordered a special Eggplant Rollatini, stuffed with crab and lobster meat, served with vodka sauce and mozzarella.  The spaghetti was delicious, and the staff served me imported Calabrian red pepper flakes (which were fantastic).  My wife's dish was beautiful, and though I don't eat crab or lobster, she said that it was one of her favorite dishes of all time!  That's a big statement, since my wife likes almost any food she orders. For desert, we ordered one of our favorites, Zabaglione.  Ordinarily, I love this egg yolk custard, but Il Falco managed to make it even more fantastic.  They bring over a hot plate and cook it at your table!  The waiter broke the eggs (with gloves on, of course, which were disposed of immediately after he separated the yolks), and put them in the pan with marsala wine and sugar, and went to work.  He then poured the luscious custard over a medley of blackberry, raspberry, and blueberry.  It was phenomenal!! As a special treat, the waiter served us a bit of house-made limoncello, one of my favorite Italian delicacies!  It was incredibly delicious! During our meal, another table ordered a Caesar Salad, which they made in the traditional style (table-side, much like our desert).  We heard the diners raving about it!

Although they were out of some items on the menu we all had more than enough choices. No one had to settle. The food was very good and everyone in our party enjoyed what they each ordered. Guacamole seem like it was made just for us it was so fresh. One in our party had all you can drink mimosas, that were a good deal at $15. Service was very good and everyone of us would be happy to return. TVs are mounted so guys can spy a game while not looking like you are disengaged from your date/wife/party! Nice modern decor with very clean, updated bathrooms. Good choice.

Cozy atmosphere and dive bar vibe, although as another poster noted, the prices are probably too high to be a true dive bar. In the front room is a well-used bar and several booths. In the back room is another bar.  On the night we were there, both bars were comfortably full, with an interesting mix of patrons. As another poster mentioned, the hipster crowd was gloriously not represented!!! I ordered the lamb gyro, and my companion ordered the fish and chips. I have had many gyros in my life, and I can happily say this one ranked among the best.  The lamb was fresh and high quality, and the yogurt sauce was on point!  The pita was soft and fresh. Couldn't be better. The fish and chips was reported to be outstanding as well, as was the side salad, which I tried a bite of. The balsamic vinaigrette had a unique taste....flavorful and slightly salty....and really made the salad. The service was speedy despite being full, and the waitress was friendly and efficient. I would definitely return.

This fact obviously resonates in the back of the staff's mind as it took 13 minutes for 2 cokes to come up at the bar side and then 5 mins after for me to give up on the waitress and grab it myself. Let's not even begin with how 1 order came out an easy 15 minutes prior to the other order all on the same bill. I'm yet to even take a bite of the food because I am that upset with this service.

We went for Sunday brunch and since my friends are notoriously last-minute or *spontaneous* as they like to call it, we didn't have reservations. We pretty easily got a couple seats in the lounge area. The problem with that area is that, to my knowledge, there is only ONE server for that area. So every time he came over, each table attacked him to get the one thing that kept getting forgotten. Pros: -Food was surprisingly delicious! I'm always wary of drunch locations but the hash was DELISH -Decor is quite nice and the dining area is quite large! -Really on-point Sangria! I tried two reds and a white and all were good. Would go with the white again. Cons: -The plates are HUGE and don't fit on the tiny tables. It was a constant balancing act that got old real quick. -It took 15 minutes to get our drink once ordered. I know it's busy but it even took 15 minutes and asking 3 bus boys later to get our WATER. I'll be back with a reservation at table. It's a great gem in my home of the UWS!

He was more than happy to suggest drinks that was alcohol free and answered our questions about the menu with grace. The appetizer (taco for two) was actually made for four! we could not finish it!! I do recommend the chicharron, (it's shrimp) it surpassed my expectations! We did not have to wait very long for our main course to come out. The one tiny complaint I'll have is that we asked for the steak to be well done, by the looks of it, it was probably a medium.

Pro-tip from her, even if you don't have a reservation, come in at 1:30 or later and you will likely be seated, or asked to wait only a bit. They purposefully don't book every table with a reservation. The place is huge and beautiful. Often booze brunches are held in places that aren't great and can devolve into drunken rowdiness but everyone was holding themselves together nicely. Onto the food and drink. 8 different types of sangria, most were excellent. I recommend the Spanish Harlem. Our waitress was super quick getting us additional drinks, and was nice enough to make suggestions. Food was very solid. Everything came out hot and was well prepared.

They only take weekend brunch reservations for a 12 o'clock seating or a 2 o'clock seating to limit boozy brunch-comers to 2 hours. It's enough time, especially with the staff being ON POINT with their service. You must make a reservation far in advance. I'm talking 3 weeks to a month. Typically my girls and I will make a reservation while we are there for the next outing. It works wonderfully. The place is always packed! From the moment you are seated, the attentive staff will get you a glass of sangria from the many choices. I've probably tried about 3/4 of them and they are all good! One of my other favorite parts about Calle Ocho is the bread basket! Yum!! The bread is always warm and the delicious strawberry butter is amazing. As for the entrees, many are delicious. I wish there were more options, or that they rotated the menu seasonally so that I wouldn't always order my favorite dish, the torte de pollo. Food comes out very quickly, so eat slow and keep on boozin'! 4 or 5 glasses of sangria later, we all leave happy, full and quite drunk. It's easy to get a lot of drinks during your visit, even with the crazy rule that you can only have one glass of sangria at a time. If you have some left, better chug it before the waiter comes back, because they will take it away! **I'd recommend the later seating, at 2PM, because they likely let you stay later than 4 and you can get an extra glass and finish it in the bar area! Or at least I've done that before.

Our waitress was terrible and several times ignored us with empty pint glasses. when we ordered a round it would show up in spurts over 10 minutes and not all at once. Food was ok, but not great. Took 3 times to ask for a side of mayo. I added ""bay"" fries for a dollar extra. It was a ripoff with just a small amount of old bay on them. Over a 3 hour period we each had 3 beers but wanted more. The only one who was doing anything was the young girl running out the food. The staff where fighting at one point due to one of them walking into the other one and spilling some drinks. They all seemed to be in a rush and didn't know what to do.

The addition of unusual specialty pizzas solidifies its outstanding rating. Take, for instance, the spinach and roasted tomato red pie. Each mouthwatering bite of juicy spinach and flavorful tomato is sure to leave your tastebuds tantalized and your tummy craving more. The sausage and broccoli rabe was another winner. Paper thin slices of sweet Italian sausage and juicy chunks of broccoli rabe combine perfectly in this heavenly slice. The brisket, brown gravy, and mashed potato was a sleeper hit. It was like eating a tasty open-faced dinner sandwich. Perhaps my only gripe is the bread is a little thick, but it's cooked nicely and does have a lot of ingredients to support. There's a lot to like about Rustica. Give it a try if you haven't already.

The success of this restaurant has to be attributed to their owner, who you will find seating customers, bussing tables and bringing out food on busy nights. He is a wonderful guy who really strives to serve delicious food in a relaxed and comfortable environment. The food- Yes, their burgers are absolutely to die for but they have more upscale menu items as well. Nightly specials vary from duck to steak to lobster ravioli. Everything is fresh and put together well. There's also a decent selection of local beers on tap. The staff- Extremely friendly, attentive and knowledgable of their menu items. On a few occasions our party has waited a substantial amount of time for our check to be dropped off or drinks to be refilled, but I think this may be attributed to understaffing.   The environment- Murphy's is a true pub environment: wooden booths, tightly squeezed tables and a big bar with large TVs. I've heard people complain about tables being too small but it has never bothered me. Overall, if you're in the Hanover area you should definitely visit Murphy's for some good food and a cold beer.

292009,70662,204,4.0,1,2015-01-06,"A casual, cozy neighborhood restaurant-deli-bakery complex. It's located on Georges Rd in South Brunswick. There are two buildings: one houses the restaurant, and the other houses the bakery and deli. The restaurant often hosts events, such as wedding receptions, sweet 16s and bar/bat-mitzvahs. It does events quite well, as the inside is elegant and grand. I've heard good things about the event catering and general organization. I ate at the restaurant once and found it okay. It's pretty pricey, and I didn't like the food enough to go back after that one time. I go to the deli and bakery a lot more. The deli is a little pricey too, with subs and sandwiches at $7 and sides at around $3. Some of the food is really good, like the sweet potato fries and mozzarella sticks, while other food isn't worth buying, like the very plain grilled cheese for $3+ and the average sandwiches/subs. It's a good casual lunch or dinner spot though with a few tables in the brightly lit, cozy hall. A lot of people stop in for breakfast too, as it has a wide selection of breakfast sandwiches, pancakes, toast, coffee, etc. The bakery is at the end of the hall, and features display cases with a huge variety of sweets and baked goods. It has cake slices, cheesecakes, different cookies, biscuits, macarons, bagels, doughnuts, fresh breads and pastries. All the sweets are very sweet and rich, so I'd recommend sharing a treat with someone else for dessert. Fair warning: the cream on the made-to-order cakes is also very, very sweet. I highly recommend the bagels and doughnuts, especially when they're freshly made in the morning. The bagels are super soft and fluffy on the inside, and only 75 cents each. Overall, Pierre's is a diverse neighborhood fixture with a ton of traditional menu, deli and bakery options. It can be pricey though.

Of the 3 South East Asian restaurants in the area, its cooking is undoubtedly the worst. I personally detest the food and will not dine here unless a friend insists to come. The restaurant does have nice renovations, and it is suitable to bring friends especially for some food discovery (for those that cannot distinguish the poor cooking). The furnishing is cozy and true to its origin. It feels like a proper restaurant, although usually quite noisy when full. However, the staff here is absolutely horrible and rude. They are impatient and often neglects your table. I find the service here unacceptable every time I dine here. I do not accept good business as an excuse for poor service. The cost is moderate for its targeted customer. As this restaurant focuses on serving local populace, rather than authenticity, I think the pricing is about right. I am pretty sure the local population agrees with the pricing, as it's jam packed every weekend. I for one will NOT dine in this restaurant even if it is FREE. In conclusion, I think this is an over-hyped restaurant that deceive the local populace of good Malaysian food. However its extremely good business speaks well for the business model. Despite this I will never dine here if given the choice, as its food quality is poor and customer service is probably the worst in all of Philadelphia. It is THE ONLY restaurant that I never tip in any significant amount.

This is a great place for a casual date, get together, and even birthday celebrations... They renovated a few years ago to a more modern aesthetic. I did prefer the old ""authentic"" hut inspired interior but I understand the update did attract new customers. Luckily the prices have not changed drastically over the years despite the modern renovations (thanks!!). Like everyone has said, the roti canai is bomb. I try to order just enough to share, although I'm compelled to want assn order for myself.... But that will just make me full. I've ordered various dishes on the menu throughout the years... Vegetables, seafood, meats, noodles, desserts etc. Most are fairly good, with the exception of some dishes that weren't my thing flavor wise (too strong seasoning, salty, etc.) I'll admit, over the past few years, ive mostly gone here only when I crave two dishes. Roti canai and spicy Thai chicken (with chicken rice). They are absolutely my favorite thing in Chinatown to eat.. Probably more than soup dumplings (sorry dim sum garden). Like I said, I've been coming here for decades, mostly for these two dishes. The simpleness of these two dishes are unmatched. The flavor profile simple, but executed so well and consistent.

The workers here are VERY friendly despite the hustle and bustle (there was a lot of people here even on a Monday evening, which talks about how popular this place is). Our waiter was SO friendly.

Also got the entree size Provence black truffle dish. It was still a small size and pricey, but I think worth it. I love truffle!

300769,165212,2634,3.0,1,2015-01-09,"I'll preface this by saying that this rating reflects a mixture of food and service. Really, if we averaged it, it'd be probably be a 2.5 (4 for food, 1 for service). We arrived at the restaurant a bit on the early side (~6:15pm) on a Friday night so we could put our names in. Not an issue as the restaurant wasn't completely full yet. They wouldn't seat us until the full party was here (I get it), but ended up seating a party of 6 who came a bit after. us and another party of 3. Strange move considering some of the party of 6 promptly half disappeared (to get cash/booze/who knows). Food - overall, very tasty and well-done. We ordered: brussel sprouts (yum, but mutant sized sprouts), portobello mushroom (cooked just right), grilled baby artichokes (very tender but a bit aggressive with the lemon), octopus salad (fabulous), mussels (again, mutant sized, but really yummy), and a smattering of other entrees and desserts. Overall, good pricing and value for delicious, fresh food. Service - We had a bit of a snafu with our check so PLEASE MAKE SURE TO COUNT AND DOUBLE COUNT YOUR BILLS! Given it's a cash only place, it's pretty easy to miscount for both the consumer and restaurant. Our bill ended up being ~$168 so we threw in $200 to include tip and told them not to give us any change. Not sure if it was because we were lingering and finishing coffees or what, but an awkward time later (i.e. not immediately after they took away the $$), the waiter returned with $22 in change. Mmm, where's our additional $10, buddy? After confirming with ourselves that we in fact did put in $200 (which was counted meticulously by our very sober and very asian friend), we brought it up with the manager (Or host?). The waiter ran over quickly to let us know that we only put in $190 and that was the correct change. Who knows what happened there but chalk it up to what happens what you have a cash only business. Obviously a disappointing end to an otherwise great meal.

300772,165214,2634,2.0,1,2015-01-07,"I came to this restaurant having high expectations based on the positive reviews I read online. The entire experience was pretty disappointing. First off, the restaurant was freezing. Most people in the restaurant were wearing their winter jackets still. My guess is when it is warmer out the place is perfectly comfortable, but it was below 20 outside that day and the room was definitely struggling to heat up. We decided to order the antipasti plate and the pear flat bread. The flat bread was the highlight of the night. The antipasti plate was a huge disappointment. It was boring and basically just a plate of slightly cooked, poorly marinated and under-seasoned vegetables. I opted to get the sole for my entree, and again I got a plate of very bland fish and sides. The green beans were actually under cooked and had no flavor other than a bit of olive oil brushed on. The fish was dry, and the tabouli salad side dish was decent but nothing special. And everything was just kind of put on the plate with no care of presentation. When I go out for a nice, high end meal, it is typical that not only the food tastes good, but the plating is very beautiful as well. My friends ordered the tuna and the pork chop and they seemed pleased, so perhaps I didn't order the ""right thing."" But at the same time, in my opinion,  a good restaurant doesn't have a wrong thing to order, everything should taste great. For the record, I am someone who is a huge foodie and I have eaten at some top rated restaurants. I understand that my expectations can be a little high at times, yet this restaurant seems to be considered one of the more ""foodie"" option on Philly that is also at an affordable price (I'm a grad student so this is key). I get that Philly isn't as much a food destination as some other cities, however, I know I am not the only one in this city who is a foodie and appreciates amazing food, so to those people I would say this: this restaurant probably would not last in cities like NYC, Chicago, or other ""foodie"" cities. Lastly, if you want a better greek/Mediterranean food experience for the same price, visit Effie's on pine street.

We were in a private room as part of a party.  The service was great.  The only advice to the staff is to not get in a hurry.  I did not like that they tried to push through taking orders and serving desert while the guest of honor was speaking.  I realize it was a Tuesday and it was late but it seemed rude to speak while someone was speaking.  This is why I didn't order desert or coffee.  Maybe just offer coffee at this point.  Otherwise, the staff was friendly and on top of the service.

The chicken inside the chicken and waffles...wow. just wow. I will go back to get just the fried chicken, it was outstanding!!!! And they give you maple syrup.

And it tasted sooooo good.it didn't look like the usual deviled eggs. A must have for the appetizer. For the entree we orderd the 8 piece fried chicken bucket with a side of waffles. By far the best fried chicken I have had so far in NYC. The chicken is marinated in a homemade brine for a day and then sprinkled with lemon powder and It had the right amount of crispyness. It goes well with their homemade bourbon and spicy honey sauce. Sprinkle it over your chicken and dig into it. The side of waffles were topped with cheese and it went well with the fried chicken. We also ordered a side of Mac and cheese which was too cheesy and heavy with a bit too much of salt. At the end of it we were all in a food coma.

We chose to sit at the bar. We split the chicken and waffles sandwich, mussels, and the mac & cheese. For dessert we got the lattice pie and swapped vanilla ice cream for the stout ice cream. Everything was delicious, only thing I would comment on is the salt content in the food. I drank through 4.5 big glasses of water, I'm 100% the food would taste just as good - if not better - if they cut back on the salt. The mussels were my favorite part, followed by my cocktail: Kill Devil Hills. My date's favorite part was the chicken and waffles, followed by his cocktail: Whiskey Cobbler. Their stout ice cream was so good! When coming here, be prepared to spend, they are expensive. I'm very glad I came and tried the place, but it is not a place I would frequent.

301577,128734,1269,1.0,1,2015-01-02,"So, like everyone else who comes here, I was suckered in by ny.eater's review of the purportedly amazing fried chicken at root and bone. Nicholas, our server, told us that they were voted to have the best fried chicken in New York (by whom was not mentioned). When we sat down I checked to see if my fav Pete Wells reviewed Bone in NYT. Apparently he hadn't (Wells don't got time for this Alphabet City ""best fried chicken in town"" nonsense) so I was left with a review in Bloomberg. It turned out that all of this reviewer's favorite items were off the menu. Three other menu items were off the menu too because they ""ran out"" by 10pm when we sat down (when normal people sit down for dinner in NYC). I suggested they reverse run out of items by keeping some items off the menu until reasonable time (like 8). Nicholas wasn't amused. Fried chicken was underwhelming. Grits and deviled eggs were good, and root vegetables had nice acid. Bur let's be real this place is genuinely terrible; terrible like how your San Francisco friends tell you they could never live in NYC because it's too busy, of course, only after having visited midtown just under Central Park; after walking through Greenwich village to get to brunch they report its starting to grow on them. I asked Nicholas about his experience working at Bone, saying the place reminded me of Georges' ABC kitchen (not in a good way - the place feels like it's trying to be Alphabet City low key chic but it is trying SO HARD). Customers are hustling hard too -- everyone is having their ""special nite (no not night) out in amazing nyc"" at this cool place far from the subway that the read about in a food blog - ""don't worry, Avenue B these days is totally safe."" Because really, let's be real -- $35 chicken is obviously NOT low key. The place feels disingenuous -- trying hard to be chill low key but making probably $30 margins on its most frequently pushed (but so highly rated!) menu item. I couldn't take it seriously. I left the place laughing. We'll not be back.

Their sausage crushes and the large open room makes it a great place to go with friends or a big group.

Once it's busy though it does get loud... think beer hall in every sense of the words. I'm all about their sausage but the kale salad is also bomb... bring your veggie friends they have vegan sausage too! The fries are drenched in flour so are NOT gluten free but if you don't have that problem then damn they are good especially with their house sauce. Beverage wise Spritzenhaus is definitely for the beer lover, offering a ton of selections on draft as well as seasonal and a ton of small batch craft beers you probably can't find anywhere else in these parts (plus 4 different gluten-free options!!). They also have a good cocktail list complete with seasonal cocktails and I'm a big fan of their wine carafes... which they offer in quarter liter, half liter or a whole liter. I've tried all their reds and all have met my approval and I've also never received an oxidized pour which for a beer bar primarily is kind of unheard of.

Both are good, and they're willing to customize those concoctions to your liking (I asked for a certain juice minus the apple, with a bit of extra lemon--no problem!). So... What I like: 1. The food! It's healthy fare with many vegan and GF options. Tonight I had the stuffed avocado with a side of fluffy quinoa. Both were delicious and had me wishing I would have ordered more! 2. They are on Seamless--what's not to love about that? Delivery was shockingly faster than the estimated time, so points there! 3. I've only ever been in, again, for take-out juice/smoothies, but the interior is really cool! I love the vibe and Caribbean decor. They have plenty of seating, both tables and a communal-type counter. Sadly, it's almost always empty when I drive by, which scares me. This place is good! Get there, people! 4. Great location right on Bloomfield near the 2 adjacent Indian restaurants. So, expect street parking or the paid lot there behind those buildings. Could use improvement: 1. My sweet tooth cannot be tamed! That said, I wish they offered dessert consistently. It appears as though they're experimenting with some (check out their FB page), but I'd definitely like to see some set options added to the menu--and at least a couple that suit a vegan/GF diet. 2. Their menu denotes vegan items with a V, but not GF items. This should be easy enough to do and would avoid me having to ask about everything. And while on this topic, I wish they'd make some simple changes to certain menu items to accommodate wheat allergies/sensitivities. For instance, mac and cheese... why not use quinoa or brown rice pasta? Both are healthier alternatives to ""regular"" white or whole wheat pasta, taste the exact same, and would open that option up to more customers (I, for one, would order M&C weekly--possibly more). So, the verdict... I'm glad I finally got around to ordering some food and will definitely be trying out some other menu items in the near future. But, can a girl get some dessert please!?

I'm not an easy girl to please and I can honestly say that Sushi Yasuda has the best sushi I have ever had. From the moment I walked in the door and checked my coat- no need for a ticket, he would remember which one was mine. That was when I knew the service would be great. I had the omakase at the sushi bar and in my opinion this is a must if you are coming to Yasuda. It is part of what makes the experience so amazing and the give you so much.  I certainly paid less than what I would have al a carte.   Our sushi chef was so hospitable and chatted with us about where the fish came from and the preparation that goes into the service at Yasuda. He appeared to be the oldest among the sushi chefs. I wish I remembered his name because he really is fantastic and I would absolutely come again just for him. Must-   1) Sea Urchin- Uni (melts in your mouth like butter)             2) Blue Fin Tuna             3) Cherrystone Clam I would only drink about half of my green tea before it was quickly replaced with another pipping hot one. Fresh towels before and after the meal. For the quality of the sushi the price is fair and they do not require you to leave a gratuity. Highly recommend!

I ordered sushi classics, a la carte -- the salmon, the hamachi, the various tunas -- and all my usual favorites. Everything was just as delicious as I imagined -- only more so. I sat next to a rather young but very much in-the-know tourist from Monaco who told me she was flying back to France in the morning but that she refused to leave NYC without trying this legendary restaurant.  Her friends could accompany her: so we were two adventurous souls in the same boat, in search of extraordinary dining wherever we found ourselves. I do remember filling out the orders in pencil on white slips of paper and handing it back to the sushi chef who was most congenital yet exact. It was too late for a big meal or a tasting menu, or exploratory eating. But, I recall that the chef gave me a few unusual pieces -- and that everything I had was like butter melting in my mouth.  'Orgasm' is a great word to describe how it was. As Yasuda once explained to Anthony Bourdain, 'it's all about the rice.'  I finally understood why.  It was a revelation and a delight beyond description, something you need to experience for yourself.  'Rice is my sushi' finally made sense, here. One of my New Year's resolutions for 2015 is to eat only at the most worthy restaurants.  Not necessarily the most trendy or most hyped -- but the tried and true and great. Those that I would not want to miss, as my transitory dining companion from Monaco explained. This restaurant certainly fits the description 'not to be missed.' This place is first class, all the way. So, with great hope for the new year I shall venture forth; to be totally immersed in one of the most exultant food highs in recent memory.

306546,19686,352,5.0,1,2015-01-01,"Made a reservation for one during my self-therapy escape from Baltimore to NYC.  Too many pictures to upload on Yelp.  For closeups and photos go here: rammiegirl.wordpress.com .   There are two kinds of omakase at Yasuda: sushi or sushi-sashimi.  I ordered the latter as I wanted more fresh fish than rice.  However, I believe that the bill was higher than what my friend quoted me because of it.  The sashimi though was so worth it.  I hope I can remember this correctly, but I believe the sashimi platter consisted of bay scallop, squid/octopus, clam, salmon, tuna, yellowtail, red snapper, butter fish.  Butter fish was probably my least favorite.  Also, I heard that it can do a number on the GI system so I was glad there was only 3 pieces.  Everything literally melted in my mouth.  The bay scallops, octopus, and clam was served with sea salt and lightly dressed with fresh lemon that the chef will squeeze on top right after serving.  Surprisingly, maguro (tuna) was not my favorite even though it usually is.  My favorite was the bay scallops followed by the salmon and then the red snapper.   I did get toro.  How can I not get toro? Sushi Yasuda supposedly has seven types of toro, but I believe you'd have to tell them that you want every single toro that they had.  I did have a fabulous assortment of other fish like sea bream and the three different parts of the large clam.  That was one fantastic clam. One of my favorites were three types of unagi (eel) sushi.  The first was a braised eel I believe.  Surprisingly, I found this to be my favorite one.  It was a little juicier than the other two.  The middle piece of unagi was from NJ and was freshwater, and the last one was from China.  I'm always wary of things that come from China just given all the chemicals and pollution in that country.  Organic foods have been tested to be not organic simply due to the amount of pollution in the rain that comes from the eastern side of the country.  But I'll save that for another post.  The piece of unagi from China was a little drier than the other pieces.  It was still very flavorful and tasted wonderful, but I can't say that it was my favorite out of the three. How good is Sushi Yasuda?  It's so good that while I normally dislike uni (sea urchin), the piece that was placed before me literally melted on my tongue like liquid gold.  It didn't have the ridiculously fishy flavor nor the quasi-firm texture that most Japanese sushi restaurants have.  I would have ordered more but reality told me my bill would have gone way more than the $200 budget I set for myself.  So worth it, I love this place.

We made a reservation because brunch is always a hectic time, but when we arrived around noon the place was almost empty. It did get steadily more packed around 2 though - maybe noon is early enough to beat the rush? This place definitely met my (high) expectations going in. Based on the reviews, it seemed like everyone was obsessed with the complimentary bread and 'beans' dip, and NOW I AM TOO. It was freaking kickass. The beans are in this spicy olive oil which I'm dying to replicate at home now and slather on everything, and the bread was perfect - crusty on the outside, soft on the inside. It was heaven. The entrees were also good - fresh tasting, well presented. I had the french toast, which I'd definitely recommend. Not too sweet, very fluffy, and I liked the abundance of fruit they put on it. Pecans added a nice crunch. My table mates got the kale omelette and grilled polenta, both solid dishes. The kale omelette was a bit heavy on the kale (versus the goat cheese), but it was a light choice. I'd also recommend the tiramisu, especially if you're into a more balanced tiramisu. A lot of places really glob on the mascarpone, and it becomes cloyingly sweet. Personally hate that - IMO  the whole point of tiramisu is to get that nice balance between slightly bitter and creamy sweetness - and Supper's tiramisu delivers close. Only two slight gripes I have food wise: they put sea salt on the side salads, and that's hard to distribute evenly. So it's like russian roulette, food edition. I took a bite of my friend's salad to try and was the unlucky one that got the very loaded bite =(. Also, their bloody mary tasted like straight up tobasco - I'm not a fan of that drink to begin with, so take this complaint with a grain of salt, but I thought their bloody mary was absolutely wretched. Other aspects - service and ambiance - were also solid '4' experiences. Water was never unfilled, and our main 'server' was very friendly. Atmosphere is cozy - dim lighting, wooden table, pseudo-open kitchen with a roaring flame - the whole shebang. If I lived nearby, this is a place I could see myself frequenting monthly. Prices are fair for what you're getting, and I can't see myself ever getting sick of the bean dip thing.

As soon as he cleared our appetizer plates, he came with a tray of silverware to restock our table. I love when I don't have to ask for a new knife! Food was delicious. I mean really tasty, everything had enough sauce, dressing and flavor. We all finished our meals and felt content. I noticed a manager lingering, I love when a manager is easy to find!

The professional pictures of the food had me hooked and looking forward to this spot as soon as I made the reservation. In reality, it was good but not fantastic. We had a wait a bit for our reservation. We went to the bar but didn't know how long we were going to be waiting so we didn't order drinks and we were just kind of awkwardly standing there in the way. I don't really know why that's relevant, but it was just awkward, and we aren't usually awkward people, so there was a miscue somewhere, but possibly it was us. In general, I wasn't impressed with the service from the get-go. As far as food goes, the bibimbap in the hot stone bowl was very good, but not remarkable. The burger got good reviews from my non-adventurous-eater dining companion. I really enjoyed my Korean cocktail (something with grapefruit and thyme), but it was a little small for $12 (disclaimer: this may be a Baltimorean view on pricing), and the waiter didn't come back in time to convince me to order another. At the end of the day, nothing really stood out as remarkable. I would recommend checking it out, for sure, but not somewhere I wanted to write home about.

Whether you go scallion, seafood, or kimchi (we got all of them), they are delicious and surprisingly beautiful plates. In fact, Barn Joo seems to take great pride in the appearance of their food, which is never bad unless it's at the expense of the flavor. 2. The bulgogi pot. I've eaten a lot of bulgogi, and theirs is excellent. The braised short ribs are also quite good. Meat. I like meat. It's good when it comes in bibimbap as well. Everything is good in bibimbap. 3. The wheel. It's obviously a weird and gimmicky thing to have, but winning a half dozen oysters before you even sit down? I like winning as much as my man Charlie Sheen. There are a few things that aren't my favorite at Barn Joo, but only one that I truly dislike: The cocktails. I'm not sure if it was an off-night, a new bartender, if they are all just ill-conceived or what...but without exception, everyone at the table was completely turned off by their drinks. Just to give you a little background: I have never in my life seen this group of people turn down alcohol. They are the biggest lushes I know (you know who you are), and whether they got the Laven-Honey, the Elder Fashioned, whatever...everyone just decided not to drink any more that evening. Perhaps it's our own fault for not just getting pitchers of beer, soju in a watermelon, or whiskey on ice like you're SUPPOSED to do with Korean food, but all I know is that I'll never order another cocktail from Barn Joo. I'll just drink that bulgogi pot, thank you very much.

The menu is great, it has a ton of vegetarian options on it, which can be sometimes hard to find.  Most recently, I had the vegetarian burrito, which is definitely not something I'd normally order, but I was feeling like indulging and the burrito hit the spot.  Everything tasted fresh- the vegetarian chili was a great touch that once again- is hard to find.  I appreciate the fact that the Pond House pays attention to the presentation of their dishes.  Everything comes out of the kitchen looking appetizing and very sleek and well put together.   From the looks of the table tents, they offer cooking classes ranging in price from $40-55 and varying from soups and stews to gluten free breads.  I'd be interested in taking one of those classes.  I should also mention that brunch is offered Saturday AND Sunday, and on their website it has a ""Wednesday Night Brunch"" menu. The Pond House has wonderful views, whether it be a cold and snowy day, or a beautiful, blossoming spring day.   Parking is convenient, as you can park anywhere in Elizabeth Park and walk over to the Cafe.

My aunt, girlfriend and I saw a Saturday matineé at the Shubert, and made a reservation for dinner right at 5PM. It was a cold, snowy early evening and we had time to kill after the play, so we went for a short appetite-building walk thru the New Haven green. At 5:03PM we realized that we had been patiently waiting outside the wrong door, and returned to the front entrance for dinner.  :-)   Service gets top marks. Our server was super professional, and at the same time warm and humorous. The Maitre D graciously stopped by to wish us a marvelous dinner, in a very French accent. I overheard him demand to taste the new dessert straight away- I liked his style. My girlfriend praised her sidecar, my aunt loved her tea, and I was happy to see a selection of mocktails in the Fresh Fruit category of the drinks menu. Winter is citrus season and both the blood orange and meyer lemon drinks were delicious. The food started with beautiful fresh-baked bread and butter, as well as a small French pastry filled with cheese and potatoes. I have to find out the name of these- I was instantly hooked. Oysters and clams were expertly shucked so that the shells were full to the brim with salt water liqueur. Raw bar shrimp were truly jumbo, flavorful, and the cocktail sauce hit just enough of a floral note to make it classic and unique at the same time. I also had a fantastic salad of baby spinach and sharp Roquefort blue cheese, with toasted pecans and warm poached peaches. It was now that I began to see a pattern- every dish being brought to the table was being cleaned completely. There's no way that will continue through the entree course, I thought, not with these birds (my aunt and girlfriend.). And yet cod brandade, steak bearnaise and lamb chops arrived and disappeared. This is French cuisine par excellence, and I couldn't fault any of those mains or their garnishes. We had preordered a chocolate soufflé for dessert.  The big surprise was that my girlfriend and aunt ordered two more desserts as well!  They cleaned their plates of profiteroles, petit fours and mignardises, sharing barely a bite, and the entire time remarking how they could not believe that I was eating an entire chocolate soufflé by myself. I'm the big dog! I eat appetizer, entree and dessert every time I step foot in a restaurant.  ULC cast a spell of powerfully delicious French cuisine executed at the highest level, bewitching my aunt and girlfriend into believing they could run and bark with the big dog! Union League Café is the most magical restaurant in the city of New Haven and I can't wait to go back!

314464,170700,2756,4.0,-1,2015-01-05,"My friends and I (one Japanese and two Vietnamese) came here three times over the weekend. Every time we spent less than $15 per person. Keep in mind this place is CASH ONLY.  We had: - Chao Long (Congee): For $6, it was a big bowl for my friend and I although we came with big appetite. The ""huyet"" (pork blood) was good, but the congee itself didn't tast like home-cooked rice to me. The ginger, fried onion, parsley and scallion made the whole dish complete with all the decorations and flavor. - Com Suon Bi Cha (Grilled pork chop, shredded pork/pork skin and crab patty on rice): I don't know why they call it crab patty while it is actually omelette with pieces of pork here and there. The pork chop was well-season with lemongrass smell. The broken rice (Com Tam) was not too dry and everything went great with the fish sauce. - Bun Ca Ri Ga (Chicken curry with rice vermicelli): This was too spicy for my friend. It might not be that spicy for those who eat really spicy. The portion looked big too me. - Bun Bo Hue (Hue's style beef noodle soup): It was so spicy to my Japanese friend that we had to ask for a bowl of broth, but she was not able to finish it (still too spicy for her!). It was a huge bowl for her appetite also. - Com Lap Xuong Op La (Vietnamese style sausage and fried eggs over rice): My friend wanted to try something new and it was new to him. We don't think this dish is popular in Vietnam and he said it was alright, nothing too special. However, if you've never tried Vietnamese sausage before, give it a shot! - Bun Bo Nuong (Grilled pork with lettuce on rice vermicelli): The grilled pork was well-seasoned but the vermicelli was not well-cooked (it tasted a bit raw and hard to chew). The fish sauce was not a big hit but it helped save the vermicelli. - Che Ba Mau (Vietnamese dessert with beans and coconut milk): It was a big save for my Japanese friend. She loved when she had to mix everything up. The jello and the coconut milk worked perfectly with the beans. Recommended by a non-Vietnamese!! - Ok, last round: Vietnamese sandwiches, a MUST-TRY!! The pickle was so well-made and it added a touch of sweet and sour taste to the terrific grilled pork. We didn't add any chili peppers but if you think you are pro spicy-food eater, go for them! Last but not least, the service was great. The staff was friendly and helpful. We didn't wait in line and the food came early. The restaurant was a bit far from Manhattan but if you really crave for Vietnamese food, a subway ride wouldn't be too much and you can also walk around Brooklyn's Chinatown. Did I mention they sell Dried Jackfruit Chip? You'll get a big bag for $3.25 and it could save your grouchy tummy if you have to spend hours in big museums like MoMA or Brooklyn Museum :D.

I've also tried their Pho and banh mi varieties, but always revert to the special because nothing else can really compare.  Service is usually really quick and for the most part, friendly.  Well I've officially moved out of the Sunset Park neighborhood and sadly admit that Thanh Da is probably one of the few restaurants in Brooklyn that I will miss most.

Please have a look at my pics for some of the dishes I've had and know each and every dish is well prepared, fresh, delicious and exceptionally priced for Brunch, Dinner, desserts & beverages. You just can't go wrong with dining here. What stood out for me today and why I am updating this review is two things. 1. I cannot eat shrimp anything from any restaurant without getting violently ill, now I like shrimp but eating this seafood outside of a home prepped, cleaned and cooked dish  will illicit unsightly things. I took a chance today since I'm fairly close to home & a hospital and I'm a risk taker of sorts to have their shrimp and grits dish ( I just couldn't resist ), I explained to the manager that I have an allergy to shrimp from restaurants and she assured me that they clean, prep and cook their shrimp well so I shouldn't have this reaction. I order the dish because I will react with the 1st shrimp and within minutes, Damn, the dish looked so good and tasted even better, I ate, and ate and I did not get sick at all! Another hit dish for Ltauha and excellent tasting too! 2. They now have their Liquor license in place, officially serving beer & wine as of this writing and expect to be in full swing with the Liquor by the end of this week. Woot, Woot, I like to have the option of a mixed cocktail with my dinner and now that just became possible at this lovely restaurant!

There were four empty tables which sat four and they would not allow me and my guest to sit there.They said policy would not allow it despite the fact that I waited there 25 minutes watching the four empty tables. I needed to sit at a communal table in the center, that was crowded and uncomfortable or wait for a table for 2. I would have calmed down eventually after being seated. However, the young very young snobby owner approached me after I finally got a table and further irritated me by talking about his MANY years of experience and money making seating policy,  blah blah blah. After all he would possibly miss out on seating a table of three or four. He even stated statistics how tables turn around in 40 minutes and treated the whole thing like a moneymaking factory. He basically said they're busy restaurant and bragged that they are always crowded!! They are right now on top of the world,  after all we all love when trends are brought into Montclair. Well I've been in Montclair almost 40 years and let's see how his attitude keeps this local establishment around. It's not the policy, it's their obvious inflexibility and lack of knowing how to apologize. Apologies don't involve bragging about your success.

317664,26987,3217,3.0,1,2015-01-07,"What can I add to Mighty Quinn's Barbeque 864 reviews and counting? Why is this BBQ joint considered the Mecca of NYC cue? Why do hipsters in plaid crowd this place? Why? Why? Why? I will tell you why........... FIRST..... RIBS...When eating ribs they should have a slight pull, a tug. If they fall of the bone way over cooked. BRISKET...When eating brisket the touch should be firm. You should be able to pick up a piece and not fall apart. If it does, way over done. FLAVORS...When eating cue the spices should compliment and enhance the meat. Not over power. Walking in you may be overwhelm with first impressions; open seating, what do I do; how do I order; and most important some nice bbq aroma. Good start. First walk to the back and get on line. Be ready to go ""on overdrive with some good looking cue"". As you wait, you can see the menu on a blackboard on the wall. Everything that can be purchase by the pound. Pricing seem a bit overpriced, but this is NYC and bbq is expensive. BRISKET I ordered a half pound of brisket. This slab of meat looked moist with a nice bark. I could see that bbq magic; that beautiful bbq pink or reddish ring. Now on this particular late Saturday afternoon there was a new guy training on how to cut brisket. I don't want to sound mean, but he was Freddie Kruger in training. Made the line slow with his Kruger cuts. He had a tough time learning to hold the cuts of meat (the point and flat), but he did cut against the grain. While the meat was moist, it was way over cooked. I am old school when eating bbq; hands only and the brisket just broke apart. Had to use a fork. You could tell that the piece was held in the warmer an hour or two to long. Now the taste was very good. It had a balance of smoke and rub. Meat was not overpowered by spice rub. The cuts had the smoke ring magic. I must say, that if I had a brisket sandwich it would have been one of the best, but I did not have a sandwich. I had slice brisket. I know I am being very critical, but everyone says Mighty Quinn's Barbeque is the best. Well the ""best"" has to be the ""best"" in flavor, texture, appearance, smoke and spice. RIBS I ordered a pound of ribs. Freddy Kruger guy did a better job with the cut. Nice clean cuts with the same amount of meat on both sides. I think we got 6 or 7 ribs from the back side of the rack. Now I have to mention this because the couple in front of me received the front cut of the rack. This is the smaller ribs on the front of the pig and near the neck. By appearance they where dry, overcooked and looked like something from a backyard grill. I would be livid if I received these bones. At 20 something a pound; C'MON MAN. The rib appearance was very nice: meaty, bark, smoke ring. It had all the qualities I look for in quality bbq. They where a beautiful thing with that meat balanced on both sides of the bone. On the first bite I was overwhelmed by cumin. I asked my wife if my conclusions where correct and she roger that. The cumin overpowered the rib. Bottom line, there was no balance of spice and pork. I knew I was having a rib, but if I was blindfolded; I would not be able to tell you the meat cut I was having. The spice rub which usually consists of 12, 14 plus spices in different ratios was not properly mixed. A great rib should have a round bite mark on the rib after first bite. The rib meat just came right off. No pull. No tug. Just clean bone. Very disappointing rib(s). I could not enjoy the smoke or meat with so much cumin taste. We had a couple of sides and they where very good. One was a beet salad. My wife really enjoyed the salad. I just don't go to a cue joint for salad. The other was a broccoli salad that was very good. Helped balance the bbq flavors. They had about 6 or 7 craft beers on tap for about 5 or 6 dollars. Tasty and had a few with my meal. I am very impressed with the history of Mighty Quinn's Barbeque and their owner who with $600 and a passion for cue opened a restaurant. Is Mighty Quinn's Barbeque the best, I don't think so after my recent visit. I think there might be times of great cue, but I see quality suffer from time to to time. Consistent cue is one of the greatest challenges with bbq cooking. My recent visit experienced meats that where way over cooked. Yes, the brisket was tasty, but with a high price I require the best. Ribs below average. While the staff was friendly and timely with service, they do not have the passion with cue. It is just a job for them to pay rent. At one time Mighty Quinn's Barbeque may have been the best, but I saw and tasted an average product that is not consistent with flavor, texture, appearance, smoke and spice.

317666,66259,3217,5.0,1,2015-01-02,"For some reason I felt the need to write another review for Mighty Quinn's BBQ. I've continued to continuously visit the spot and have become no less impressed with their brisket. July 4th (in an hour plus line extending up 6th Avenue), I was at Mighty Q's! The same day arriving back in NYC after driving from South Carolina, I was at Mighty Q's! This is some darn good bbq brisket! I actually get mines without bbq sauce sometimes just to add some mustard based Cattleman's if walking home to indulge. Anyone truly familiar with BBQ will understand the different flavors from different regions. Disappointedly, I have noticed little less of the side fixin's {coleslaw (your choice of vinegar or mayo based), peppers, onions, pickles, and cucumbers} given with the meal. Nevertheless, the same flavor still remains in tact, as well as good deep sleep to ensue after devouring. The meat is slowly cooked over a lower heat where smoke flavor becomes infused into the meat. Tip: Eat cautiously. Can (will) cause drowsiness.

We went in a Sunday afternoon and needless to say the service was much better. They still have an extremely long list of specials which I still think is a bit ridiculous, but if your server is pleasant you can take your time going back through them to find what you're looking for. All our lunch guests were exceptionally pleased with their meals and I was told the scallops were some of the best they'd ever had - they loved the presentation of them still in their shells. Most of the dishes are a bit heavy, lost of oils or creams in the sauces, but they are well prepared and the pastas and meats are cooked expertly. I think perhaps it is better to come for lunch than dinner as you'll have a more gracious - or at least less frazzled - staff who can help you navigate the menu.

The service was very attentive, and for a large party (I think there were 5 or 6 of us) the waiter cut up and distributed the appetizers among us. Not totally necessary, but nice. Like others have said, they list off a bunch of specials-- And I mean a bunch as in over 10 appetizers and 15 entrees.  They wont really repeat them for you and they aren't written down anywhere.

Service-Very bad, waiter never checked back about the food and/or asked if we needed anything, basically dropped the food and left.  We also were charged for something we ordered which never was dropped off.  It was taken off the bill but would have preferred getting something we ordered.  We were glad we didn't as it probably wasn't that good anyway. Food- Cheeseburger, dried out with an old bun, asked for a new bun after flagging the waiter down and got another dry flaky bun, threw the bun out and just ate the dry patty.  It came with a salad which seemed almost like some salsa or something-not good.  The blue cheese however was pretty good.  We also got a basic salad with a garden burger, average at best, didn't finish it. Will not be returning, I can deal with subpar food if the service makes up for it and vice versa great food, poor service but not both.  Not sure what the buzz on this place is, reviews are good per yelp.  I will not be back, too many other outings

320329,172979,2787,2.0,1,2015-01-02,"Well im sorry. Perhaps my tastebuds differ alot from the other reviewers but i didnt see what all the hoopla was about. I came in yesterday expecting to be blown away but as u can tell i didnt. First the service wasnt too good. I waited 37 minutes for my appetizer which were the Buffalo wings. The sauce was actually pretty good and so was the blue cheese. But the wings themselves lacked. They were awfully skimpy with only a few of them containing sufficient meat. Then we waited another 26 minutes for our main course. This was by far the longest i have ever waited for my food. I will say it was kinda busy but then the issue of ordering file came to fruition. Less that 20 minutes when we came in, another couple entered and ordered the same items we did and they recieves their orders within 15 minutes. Someone please explain that to me. Ok so on to the food that took way too long for what it was. First i had the so called ""spiced"" angus burger with fries and carmalized onions. My fiance' had their buffalo chicken breast sandwich. I start with the plating. More than ample sized portions.  The burgwr was very large and the side of fries were way too much. The fries over take the plate but thats ok, who doesn't like fries. Then i look at my burger that looks so juicy and tasty but alas it was not. There was no flavor in the burger. Where was the ""spiced"" part? I waited a little over an hour for this? I was extremely disappointed. Infact i left more than half of it on my plate because i couldnt force myself to eat it. Then i checked the onions and the were more like soggy onions rather than carmalized. Again maybe my taste in food is different than everyone. Onto my the grilled chicken breast with buffalo sauce. The chicken was tender and juicy. Two decent sized pieces placed on the bread with diced carrots and celery. There was a considerable amount of blue cheese on the other slice. It was actually pretty decent. It was the only thing that saved my meal. I will say this sometimes we allow ourselves to be swayed too much by reviews and sometimes we miss out on something great or sometimes our expectations are not met. With that said its best that you try places on your own despite reviews because after all we all have a different sense of taste and enjoyment. As for me, i wont be returning here to eat. Not enough umph to make me reconsider. Happy eats folks

What I wasn't prepared for was the hostess pretty much forgetting about us and skipping over us a couple of times. We finally got a table, a six top made by one two top and one four top pushed together... and then seating a couple next to us on the other half of the four top. Why they didn't separate the tables and put our party at the four top and the couple at the two top is beyond me. Our waitress seemed spaced out, nice but completely not with the program and kept forgetting things. It IS a veggie and vegan place, which does get major points in my book. I will say, the bucket of spuds was amazing. Definitely one of the best things on the menu. Unfortunately, that was the best thing I ate there, the rest of our food, nothing special, nothing to write home about, if anything, kind of bland.

323866,53884,1526,5.0,1,2015-01-05,"It IS that good.  I took my parents today just because I had to prove to them the deliciousness that I always speak of.  My mom hates cheese. My dad isnt a spicy adventurous type guy so neither parent was thrilled with the menu as they saw it online....UNTIL.....they had lunch there. I ordered the Bee Sting Pizza. OMG. What can I say? It's always INCREDIBLE. Even my un-spicy dad LOVED it.   My dad ordered both the smoked ribs and the calzone. We all shared the ribs and I was shocked at the taste...very different with the honey and vinegar and the delish crust .....I would order it again in a second. So glad he selected it.  The calzone was enormous and just like the pizza but wrapped up/folded over as a calzone should be. My mom was limited because she is a bland diet type of person but she debated between the burger and the bacon egg & cheese on the croissant minus the cheese. She was in love with that sandwich. The potatoes alone were beyond yummy. All in all, I knew it was good but for my parents to rank it an A is shocking. My dad said it looked like a 'mess' from the outside, but the food, he stated, was some of the best he has had in a very, very long time.  My mom even asked the waiter how to make the potatoes and wrote her name on the bag that has her remaining 1/5 of the croissant sandwich that she refused to leave over but doesnt want my dad to eat. I took home a sticky bun, which the waiter said they make in house. It looks delish but I have not tried it yet. I have only been home a couple of hours after eating there and I could go for another Bee Sting pizza.   PS I was nervous about a wait but lunch on Monday at 1245 when we arrived, produced no wait; about 75% of the tables were taken before/after our arrival.

323869,95520,1526,5.0,1,2015-01-05,"I decided my first review of 2015 should be for Roberta's.  Yes, there are 1200+ reviews already so why add another? Well, why not? Besides I like to think I have my own slant on things. In this reviewer's humble opinion, there's not much reason to go to Bushwick (at least currently), except for one: the pizza at Roberta's.  And it's a damn good reason to go. I went to check out the legendary Brooklyn pizzeria with my sister over the holidays.  We expected a long wait, but were happily surprised to be seated within 5 minutes.  There's a main dining room that you'll see once you enter, complete with bar in the back, but there's also a smaller dining area that is ""outside.""  It is a covered space with a wood burning stove in the middle that provides more than ample heat.  We were very comfortable even in December. The pizza is made in a wood burning oven, so you smell all the delicious flavors of the various pizzas being ordered the moment you walk in the door.  After perusing the brunch menu, my sister got the Guanciale & Egg and I went with the Millennium Falco (what can I say? I love Star Wars).  The pizzas are personal pan sized and more than enough for one person.  If you're not starving, I'd even say two people could share one.  Both of the pizzas were delicious although I recommend getting an extra egg for the Guanciale because it adds a nice flavor dimension to the pizza and one egg just didn't satisfy us.  I paired my pizza with a draft Ninkasi Total Domination IPA, which I had never tried before but would recommend to anyone. After we demolished the pizzas, it was time for dessert.  Our hipster waiter (decked out in a Jets t-shirt worn inside out and a beanie hat) gave us options of egg-nog sorbet, hazelnut sorbet, and celery & peanut butter sorbet (which our waiter said with a very dead-panned hipster voice as if that flavor was totally normal). The latter sounded odd to us, so we went with the first two.  Both were very tasty.   Roberta's is one of the best pizza places in NY and it's definitely worth trekking out to Bushwick to sample the fare. On a final note, if you want take-out, there is a separate store front just one door down that can serve your pizza needs.

The door is actually a hole in the wall, of an weird architecture mixed of brick and rusted containers. It took me two minutes to find its door, even I was there! The place must be one of the most affordable rent for commercials in NYC. When I opened the door, it surprised me that this rusted container house is almost full of customers. The background music is roadside cowboy rock & roll, which fits the restaurant's style. More weirdly, there is even a local radio station LIVE on air in one of the restaurant's rusted container, a.k.a wall as well! There is a cozy and warm heater in the middle of the room. Don't be too close to it. It burns... Usually, I avoid pizza, since pizza is an unhealthy and boring food, in my opinion. Yet, the pizza here is one of the best American Style Pizza I ever tired. $13-$17 is above average cost for a pizza, but worth it. The pizza is 'truck driver' size. Usually, half of such food volume will be more than enough for me, but I ate all of the pizza today, since it is really juicy and yummy. Usually, I never order beers during meals, esp. lunch. However, I order and enjoy the beer in this meal. It fits the pizza so well, and the wine here is over $10, a little bit too pricy. In short,  the pizza here is one of the best American Style Pizza I ever tired in the most weirded location! The music and service is good as well.

I ordered through seamless about 20 minutes ago and didn't realize until I got my email confirmation that I would be waiting between 120 and 135 minutes :-( so im hoping my food arrives sooner, and hot, and as fabulous as all the other reviews. I do think that's kind of nuts, but I will update appropriately between 120 and 135 minutes from now. Update: So my food came at EXACTLY the 120 minute mark. I thoroughly appreciate that since  it's late, and I'm starving after traveling back to Bk from vaca and traveling sucks and everyone said one thing in terms of times but meant another. Roberta's actually delivered on their promise. Why it takes so long? No clue, but they are honest about it. They also walked up 3 good flights which a lot of folks won't do. Big props. (I always tip more when they walk up.) Anyway, I ordered a kale salad and the Rosso pizza. Kale salad was delish! They dressed it prior to leaving so the beets bled a little and there was perhaps too much dressing but it was super tasty! I think a $10 .00 salad should be ABUNDANT and it wasn't, definitely not a shareable size, but super yummy. The main event...pizza was really good. Great flavor but not hot. Warm at best and chewy flexible crust. Not soggy, chewy so im guessing it was either a tad undercooked or steamed considerably in the 120 min wait. (Full disclosure...im not a pizza connoisseur, don't know the bread/crust lingo.) The 4 stars are for long delivery time, and chewy warm pizza instead of chewy/hot or crispy/hot. But hot is really impossible with that delivery time so really minus 1 star for delivery time and not  flavor is pretty damn good. And the delivery person was easy on the eyes. All that said, I probably won't order from there again, it's just too long and kind of $$, not a great value. But it delivered in flavor.

My boyfriend had a butternut squash soup which was pretty good. We chose the pesto pizza, which was delicious. Made me want to try the others of which there were a variety.  And as  usual he went with the chicken alfredo.  It was creamy in texture and a delight to eat. I went with the penne vodka with shrimp.  I thought there would be medium shrimp throughout but the shrimp were on the extra large size and succulent to say the least. It was full of flavor and I enjoyed. Didn't finish it all because I was stuffed from the pizza but I'm definitely looking forward to my leftovers from what I did get a chance to eat of my pasta dish.

We had about 15 people, so the room was quite full, but it was very comfortable, and we all fit nicely. Our waiter was extremely attentive, which considering the fact that we were all ordering drinks and food all night, was very impressive. The food was great, too. I love the concept of ""Japas"" because it allowed us to try a wide range of dishes with out spending an arm and a leg. I would definitely go back just to eat in the restaurant. The karaoke system was pretty easy to use, and the song selection definitely kept us entertained for the full 3 hours. It's so much fun, I recommend booking a bit longer than you think you'll want, or at least be prepared to pay for a bit of extra time, because you will not be ready to go when your time is up!

I'm used to karaoke in DC which can be brutally expensive just for the room charges, which means having to gather large groups of people to spread out the cost. The whole Sunday night deal of paying for dinner and then getting the room for free was too good to pass up - so good, in fact, that my friends didn't initially believe that that was the deal. So, me and my two friends got a room big enough for 8 people (which was the smallest room they offered) and they even gave it to us early since we showed up early. It was ridiculously easy to rack up enough on dinner to get the room comped, not because the prices were high (they were, in fact, very reasonable - I had two drinks, a ton of dinner, and a bunch of appetizers for about $75 total but that was a major splurge for me) but because the food was just that good. And karaoke burns calories, right? We did have a little sticker shock when we got the bill - again, all that food does add up! But we had such an amazing time. The place was clean, service excellent, machine worked well (would love it if they'd have more songs though! Again, why no Hall and Oates??) food delicious, and acoustics amazing.

The tagless tea bag was brought to me with someone's bare hands. 2. The tables were sticky, there weren't enough place settings and I had to ask for food menus (keep in mind, I made a reservation and even arrived early...there was no reason for our table to not be set up properly). 3. In the group of 7, only 2 people enjoyed their meals (potato croquettes & chicken n waffles). My order of two eggs (over-easy) with bacon & homefries were terrible. The eggs were cooked over-hard, the bacon was simultaneously raw and charred and the homefries were the color of cardboard. 4. The fritatta of the day was so tiny and came with the same weird potatoes. 5. We had to ask for butter when 5 people had toast with their meals. They brought us one spindle of butter to share. 6. My father-in-law's chair slipped from beneath him and he fell on the floor (b/c the chairs were wobbly and the floor was dirty). The staff didn't try to do anything to compensate for this. 7. The staff didn't refill our water glasses. This was just the worst place.

I came back here for a second time with my bf on a trip to Nyc and made sure to make a reservation here. We were seated immediately and started an intimate dinner. First off was the bread, which was a meal in itself. The standout was the salami baked bread, which our server happily refilled for us when she saw we'd devoured the first bit. Bread came with some olive oil, soft butter and some sort of salsa. I loved the duck &  Foie gras ravioli, which I ordered based on yelp reviews,  and it didn't disappoint one bit! Every last drop of that dark, flavourful sauce was slopped up - don't want to waste that! More than anything I love the vibe here.

327852,19819,2864,3.0,1,2015-01-06,"If you're reading this, get the creamy Polenta - it was the best part of the meal at Scarpetta. Although it may not look like much when it arrives (because polenta literally is a bowl of mush), it is a savory and umami-filled stand-out on the menu. Don't miss the polenta - it's not overhyped at all. Other than the polenta though, the rest of the dining experience at Scarpetta just felt a little off. Maybe it's that hushed whisper that Scott Conant no longer owns the NY Scarpetta or maybe it has nothing to do with that at all but everything else about the night was just OK. I never thought I cared much for atmosphere in a restaurant but I surprisingly found myself thinking the atmosphere lacked in mood. At least it does if you end up sitting in the front of the restaurant - maybe it's better in the back. Service was prompt, food and water was brought out in lightning speed, and there are no complaints about the waiters who did their job well but I found myself thinking service lacked that personal touch. This doesn't sound like a big deal for most but in my humble opinion, sometimes you just have a better dining experience when you have a memorable waiter. Most of all though, this rating really comes down to not being blown away by our food. We got the duck foie gras ravioli and the short rib & bone marrow agnolotti. While both dishes were cooked perfectly and there were some really nice flavor components going on within each dish that I won't get into (because no one frankly cares lol), I didn't like that both the outside of both pasta dishes were coated in butter and took away from the real highlights of the respective dishes.   If you're a paula dean fan and it is yes to butter on everything for you including pasta, by all means, carry on. For me, I think there's a fine line to tread with butter, and after a while the butter sauce flavor got tiring and overpowering. The bread appetizer in the beginning rocks though. It comes with a mini trio of eggplant caponata, citrus and herb-infused olive oil and (yes) mascarpone butter - but this time the butter here is great because it tastes more mascarpone than butter.

When we ordered he suggested to break up the primi and the pastas. So including dessert we had a four course meal set up. For primi we had the braised short ribs w/farrow risotto and creamy polenta. 2Nd course was more of the short ribs becuase they were amazing, spaghetti tomato basil(this will rock your world becuase it isnt like just any spaghetti) and duck foie gras ravioli (a bit gamey but If you like go get it). 3Rd courses were the turbofish, cavetelli pasta, lamb porterhouse, and beef wagu & cheek meat special. Dessert was the warm banana bread, coconut pannacotta, chocolate cake, and orange olive cake. Overall our waiter's service was wonderful, ambiance was perfect, food came in perfect timing. The only negative thing is anyone who wasnt the table waiter kept bombarding our table. We were asked if we would like still or sparking 3 times in a row.

The Foie Gras was really incredible and (as per all Foie Gras) filled with strong flavors so I don't recommend it if you aren't comfortable with that. Ultimately we couldn't decide on a single dessert so we split the Coconut Panna Cotta and the Warm Banana Bread. Both were wonderful, but I was most fond of the Panna Cotta because it was unique and not easily found elsewhere!

My friend ordered the shredded pork with veggies in garlic sauce which we both thought was good but nothing out of the ordinary. However, the minced pork with black beans and chives was absolutely delicious. I loved how they added red and green chili peppers which gave a good kick when you bite into it. On weekdays, they offer a lunch menu for less than $8/dish. The soup dumplings take a while to cook, so I suggest you place the order the first thing you arrive so you get it before your main dishes.

My boyfriend and I decided to order a burger to share after reading previous reviews. Very glad we did. We ordered the $11 doh'nut cheeseburger. Disappointed is the best way to describe my experience. The soft sugary doughnut was good, but very small, and hardly stuffed with a ""burger."" It was more like someone had squeezed hamburger helper through the doughnut hole, gooey, slimy cheese. The fries were just okay. One thing I'd like to highlight is that our server was perfectly fine. Didn't go above and beyond for us, but would you for a couple who are sharing 1 $11 burger? She did her job without an attitude so that was pleasant.

This time, I made reservations two weeks in advance and had the most amazing meal ever. We did the Chef's Tasting ($16 per person as of 1/1/15) and had an amazing meal. My daughter will eat chicken breast, but that's and seafood are the only meats she will eat, so we opted for the vegetarian option. Free jasmine tea was brought to the table, but we also ordered a pot of green tea as it was cold outside with the wind. The jasmine tea is now my favorite tea ever. The meal started with a delicious Miso and Watercress soup. After that, we were served Mock Eel (something I'd seen Alton Brown rave over and I agree with his opinion) and Vegetable Red Oil Dumplings that were not overly spicy at all and became the best dumplings I've had. The next round of dishes included the  Double Garlic Broccoli (think cashew broccoli - really well flavored with a touch of smokiness), Deep Fry Green Beans (again fabulous), and my favorite dish of the day and something I figure had to be bad for us, but tasted so good  - Buddha's Sesame Beef (made with seitan). The final dish was an eggplant that was braised in a spicy peanut sauce and served on a bed of lettuce, even this dish blew me away. After all that food, some of which we had to bring home because we were out of room, you also get dessert. We were served a tapioca pudding made with coconut milk and topped with toasted coconut and fresh blueberries. It wasn't overly sweet, which I loved, and cleansed the palate perfectly.

When I took the bag up to the place I was confronted with 2 sets of chopsticks and 2 soy sauce containers. ""This is just the classic Chinese food guilt trip,"" I thought to myself. See, as someone who frequently eats larger quantities of food than he should, I've grown accustomed to Chinese restaurants assuming that my order must be meant to feed a small family. Lam Zhou, however, was making a much more reasonable assumption. They assumed that no normal human would try to eat 24 dumplings in 1 sitting. As it turns out, they were right. Faced with this impossibly large amount of food for a mere $6, I had to retire early from my dumpling feast. You should absolutely check this place out and you might want to bring a friend with you if you plan on getting both the fried and the boiled dumplings.

Portions were very decent, everything was fresh and cooked perfectly . The prices are what you would expect for NYC, but worth it for the portions and quality.

We had reservation but were told we would have to wait 10 to 15 minutes for them to clear and set up our table, which, regardless of the short wait time, defeats the purpose of having a reservation. Fortunately for them, that was the only hiccup during our time here or my fiancé would have let them have it. The food was absolutely delicious. We shared the Thai Steak and Noodle Salad for appetizer and it was a knockout. So refreshing and pretty to look at with all the different vegetables chopped up and piled on top of one another. It reminds me of Burmese salads (for those who want to try Burmese food, go to San Francisco because New York inexplicably lacks any good ones). I had the Campfire Barbeque Ribs, while my fiancé had the Hawaiian Rib-eye Steak. Both just melted in our mouths. The coleslaw that accompanied my ribs was one of the best I've ever had. To top this all off, our server was amazing. We asked her to help us take a photo and she went above and beyond to take the best photo possible for us (it was pretty dim inside), and we weren't even thinking of a redo. We came here for a special occasion but we'll be back regularly from now on.

We did not order apps as we were eating quite a large lunch.  I had the Hawaiian Rib-Eye Steak with a loaded baked potato which was amazing.  I like my steak medium rare, more towards the rare side, and they cooked it perfectly.  The loaded baked potato was amazing I almost wanted to pick up the skin and gnaw off any leftover potato... I don't know if it was the sour cream or the perfectly cooked potato but it was really good and almost a meal in itself. We were lucky and got a corner booth.  The ambiance was nice, very dimmly lit so it felt like dinner.   The service was great minus the waitress forgetting two waters which we had to ask for twice.

I expected the restaurant to be empty but it had a decent amount of customers (this is always a sign that people love the food!). Food: My friend and I ordered the Lomo Saltado (Peruvian beef stir-fry) and it was delicious! The Lomo Saltado was juicy and tasty.The beef has this distinct taste to it, honestly my mouth is watering right now haha. Also, the dinner portion size was decent, I was so full once I was done. As for the green hot sauce, it's SO GOOD! Staff: I think the staff plays a big role in any business since this is one of the factors that would make a customer come back for more. That being said, I want to point out that Costanera's staff is excellent - very friendly and attentive! Price: The price for my dish was around $25 dollars with some change not including the tip. Establishment: Like I said in my previous review, the restaurant is dimly lit providing an intimate setting and the walls are decorated with tree rings which adds this rustic feel to the place. Also, it's BYOB which is always a plus! Tips: Make a reservation beforehand otherwise you might not be able to get a table. It wasn't crowded on the Wednesday I visited but have gone there on a weekend where they were not serving anyone without a reservation.

Since we are novice Peruvian eaters, so we started with Anticuchos (kebab) and Chori-papa; both were good, Chori-papa was a big hit by all. We ordered Pescado a lo Macho (not spicy at all...too bad!!), Arroz con Mariscos (paella like, very good especially the calamari), Lomo Saltado (Good- NOT great; lacked seasoning)  By far the best entree was the Churrasco a lo Pobre.  The steak was perfect and the combination of acu-tacu, maduros (plantain) and egg offered complex flavors - good dish. Overall the food was not seasoned well enough for our taste or as expected. Deserts included coffee ice cream (oh um) and Mousse De Chocolate (awesome). The staff was friendly and helpful. Considering the overall experience, slightly high priced $170 for four (BYOB). However we will probably return for another visit.

We picked burgers for dinner. I had the black bean burger, which was very good and slightly spicy, but it kept falling apart so it was pretty annoying to eat. It came with a salad and fries, both were decent. As far as the atmosphere, it's a pretty hip place. Seems like a good place to grab some burgers and beers. However, I wasn't a fan of how close we were sitting to other people, it was annoying especially since the restaurant was pretty dead. Overall, it was an okay experience.

I couldn't find this place because there was no name on the building. If there was, then I completely missed it. I did notice a ramen place. When I walked closer I saw the Baoburg name on the inside door. Baoburg and the Ramen restaurant shared the same main entrance, and restroom. (Not a big deal, but be aware...when it's windy out you'll need big guns just to open the door) This place is CASH ONLY!!! Entering Baoburg the place is small...10 tables, very intimate.The time we came between 6-6:30 pm and we were the only customers. Our waitress was very nice and attentive (well duh, we were the only ones there; can't miss). The menu did not have too many dishes that would overwhelm you. This place is Asian Fusion, Spanish,Tapas/Small Plates. The plates were great for sharing. So don't think it's ""small"" plates; unless you're really hunglry. We ordered, and yes it came out in this order: - Seared Duck Breast Noodle - the broth has a great body of flavor to it without it being too watered down or too heavy that balanced very well with the duck, which was cooked to a point that you still taste its origin without it being too gamy. The noddle, mushrooms, and baby bokchoy complimented well with the broth and duck. All the flavors went well together while highlighting the star of the dish; duck. - Braised Pork Belly - this dish had apple slices and cranberry that was such an amazing touch with the sauce (salty and sweet in great harmony). The pork belly was cooked very well, not overdone, just right. The dough that came with it was such a great ideal. But don't ask too much dough, two is enough for you and your companion. Too much would ruin the concept of the dis - Braised Lamb Shoulder Stew - the lamb was cooked very well, also not overdone and just right. This one had was slightly spicy. It came with a poached egg on top of a sticky rice. So you poke the egg and the yolk will spill out over the sticky rice and stew...then enjoy. I slowed down eating once I realized the dish was almost gone. Yep it was that good. We both had an amazing food experience here and will definitely come back.

Once inside, we were seated in a private back room which made the dinner feel very intimate. We were warned by our inviter to not eat lunch that day and prepare for a big meal - we didn't take the warning seriously and regretted doing so. The courses kept coming one after another, I lost count after 15 different plates came to the table. The food was surprisingly all warm and tasteful with seconds offered at each course. I was unfortunately not able to try much of the dessert because i was absolutely stuffed with authentic Italian food and wine. The only reason I didn't give Fox Place a 5 star review is for their bathroom.

I've been to 15 Fox Place for a Yelp Event and for the full dining experience. Our hosts Mary Lou and family rolled out the red carpet each time and welcomed us into their home and treated us to some really delicious food. To manage expectations, the food served at 15 Fox Place is not molecular gastronomy or a combination of fancy and expensive ingredients. This is home style honest to goodness comfort food. Those of you wanting shots of uni and sake with caviar need not read further. A typical meal at 15 Fox Place goes like this: You sit down. You've prepped for the meal to come. The first item comes out, you hungrily gobble it down. MOAR!! MOARRRRR!!! you quietly scream on the inside. Then the next one comes out. You guzzle that up too. You hope that there's enough for seconds as the plates get passed around. You may ignore common sense and dive in for another helping. Then the third one comes out, and you think you're hitting your stride. You mow it down. And on and on for the first 6 or 7 items... and then you start feeling full. The food continues to roll off of some mystical conveyor belt piping hot and you struggle to keep up with the onslaught of food. By the time you've had 10 or 11 dishes, Mary Lou or someone else will walk in and tell you to take a break. You can walk around the house, loosen the belt, and if absolutely necessary, drop off some excess weight in the middle of dinner. You feel a little flushed from the food, but you hang on. You can do this, you try to reassure yourself. Then you sit back down and the conveyor belt rolls on. You feel sweaty. You're totally full. At some point, the salad comes out. THE SALAD?!? Doesn't that come out before the main dishes? Surely. You then get courses 14 and 15 and that's the stuffed shells and the pastas and even more stuff. You beg for the meal to end but you just can't stop eating the food. Finally... you see the finish line. A molten chocolate cake. It signifies dessert. The ordeal is over... so you think. Then the cookies come out. Then the struffolies. Then the homemade zeppolei stuffed with cannoli cream. And then... you top it off with a shot of homemade limoncello, and you wonder how you didn't rupture your stomach. You thank Mary Lou or your host/hostess for a wonderful meal, and you manage to get home in a food drunk state and you sit on your couch for hours egging on your stomach to digest. You can't even sleep from the fullness. Then you start planning for the next time you're going to be back. :)

Coming from TX, I've built a pretty good palette when it comes to vietnamese food. The banh mi, the pho, the dumplings, etc. you name it. So here's why I was left unimpressed: Pork Belly Banh Mi - an overwhelming amount of fat versus meat in the sandwich; although the baguette was perfectly crispy, the contents of the sandwich overshadowed its flaky goodness. Vegetables were alright. Loaded Joju Fries - topped with banh mi toppings and a fried egg; fries were very nice and crispy but the issue was that it was flavorless. Yes, the toppings and special sauce were there to add flavor but it wasn't enough to help make up for the tastelessness of the fries. If you get it, share it. It's a good $6 for an order. Vietnamese iced coffee - biggest letdown. It was so watered down! The flavor of the coffee barely came thru. I threw it away after a couple of sips. For a sandwich, a side, and drink, I spent almost $20. Wasn't worth it at all.

Highlight was the burger for sure: juicy, flavorful. Fries were OK. Korean fried chicken and the dumplings were subpar. While the batter on the chicken was thin and crispy, it was exceedingly salty (and I usually don't mind salt). Something was off with the dumplings, too. My wife pegged it right: beware of Asian food made by white people. Also, I was a bit surprised that the two pieces of chicken were a thigh and a drumstick. Sure, dark meat stays moist, but I would have preferred one of each. I like thigh meat, but not theirs. I ordered a fantastic biscuit, but was a bit annoyed that this doesn't come with the fried chicken, which had mediocre sides. Lastly, I would have given this place three stars, but they never asked, ""How is everything?"" Major deficiency in service. Atmosphere is nice but you can do better (FD, Hometown, etc.) within a couple of blocks.

However, the customer service alone was enough to make me walk out. At the end of our meal, we asked the waiter to split the check. However, I was horrified to find out that the waiter had not listened to our request and charged over $100 on my credit card alone, even though we wrote down how much money should be charged on each card. I had essentially paid for everyone's meal. When I spoke with the hostess at the front I asked her to refund my credit card. She informed me that she could not do that right away and she proceeded to argue with me and tell me that I was wrong. At that point I asked for a manager and she told me that there is no one in charge at all; essentially the hostess and wait staff were running everything on their own and had no one to report to. I have never been treated so poorly at an establishment in my life. I was saddened at my horrible experience and I honestly will never return to any Pio Pio establishment because of this. However, I can at least take comfort in the fact that there are plenty of other wonderful Peruvian restaurants in the city that I can visit.

I enjoyed the experience, and would definitely go back if I'm in the area, but it's definitely not a place that I'd go out of my way to visit. It definitely didn't meet the ""it's one of the best restaurants in NJ"" hype I've heard. In Montclair alone I would prefer to go to Fascino or Giotto. I don't honestly think any of the restaurants in Montclair would really make me go out of my way to visit though. Out of the places in NJ I'd make a trek for you're probably only looking at Shumi, Jo-Sho, and Stage Left, all in the Somerville/New Brunswick areas. Anyway, let's review the food. Risotto with mushrooms: This was a pretty unique take on risotto. It was lighter than what I expected, more haute cuisine than your typical heavy risotto with truffles and mushrooms. It was unexpected, and very good if you're a fan of molecular gastronomy or haute cuisine. The risotto was a little runny, but otherwise it was perfectly prepared. 8/10 Crispy Duck Confit: This was probably one of the stars of the evening. Very well cooked, great robust flavors and texture. Absolutely delicious. 9/10 Grilled Octopus: Possibly the least exciting of the appetizers, but the octopus was cooked to perfection. I think the flavors and presentation could be improved upon, but I definitely enjoyed this this. 8/10 Duck Entree: This is where things get interesting. The duck itself was delicious. Very well prepared, and a lot of flavor. The cabbage and turnip however, where underwhelming. 6.5/10 Cod Entree: Interesting presentation, but overall I wasn't a fan. The dish was a little too salty, and the truffle broth, while interesting at first, quickly overwhelmed the dish. 5/10 Dessert: Basil Ice cream and Olive Cake- I had heard rave reviews about this, and although I wasn't sold upon ordering it absolutely exceeded the hype. I can't imagine this being prepared any better. The mix of flavors was exquisite. 10/10 Vanilla Creme Brûlée- Heavy, somewhat bland, and just not all that good. The sort of creme brûlée you'd expect in a cheap bakery, not a high end restaurant. 3/10 Overall, I'd say it's an 8/10. It's worth checking out if you're in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way unless you're only looking for dessert.

If the fact that they are farm to table and source many of their ingredients  from local farms isn't enough to get you to stop in than maybe the fact that they are part of the Melville Trust is. Firebox is owned by a nonprofit organization dedicated to end homelessness and The profits go back to them. It's a win, win, win. Great food and drinks, local ingredients that support local farmers and artisans, and the profits are doing good for the community and not just lining the pockets of some investors!

It's been quite some some time since we had such a friendly experience in New York... And its always so refreshing when the hostess / wait staff, bartender and manager are genuinely warm and funny. All of the food was great and wine pairings were on point.. We tried the duck breast special, the French onion gratin (VERY filling because there's brisket in it), cheese plate and burger. Needless to say, we had leftovers. The only neutral point I'd note is the price (which was by no means atypical for French in meatpacking). We will be back here soon to try the brunch menu!

We were just looking for dessert after wandering out of our subpar Greek food experience and were delighted to find this wonderful bar/restaurant. Now here's a tip for the management from someone who's in the business. The two most important things you do to make money are collecting money and taking the orders. There was a single server, who seemed to do a good job, but was overwhelmed in the front. The food came out near instantaneously so that tells me that the kitchen is well staffed and trained. But for you to make money, you need to be able to intake orders quickly. It also makes the customers happy. That's my only complaint, you need more servers. Now we had the biscuits and gravy and they were great. The dessert was some kind of a biscuit with ice cream, but tons of ice cream. There was 3 in our group and we could not finish it but the girls wanted to finish it. We painted Manhattan red with our food excursions and this was unanimously our favorite place. It was just right down the street from where we were staying on Upper West Side. Loved it here, till next time...

I really love how some NYC restaurants are taking phone numbers and will text you when your table is ready. You then have 5 minutes to get there for your table (so don't go too far for coffee). BLT Bloody Mary is awesome, and a good move especially if you're really hungry because it's essentially an appetizer with half a hard boiled egg and a slice of crispy bacon in it! Biscuit breakfast sandwich was great too! I got sausage and it was enormous. I'm usually hesitant to just get a sandwich when there are no sides, but it was plenty to eat, esp. since I had the Bloody Mary too. They have some communal tables, which is where I sat with my two friends, which I don't have a problem with, although the girl next to me stabbed a cherry tomato and it squirted on to my white sweater, but she was really nice about it and gave me her Tide To Go pen.

343889,181761,3003,5.0,1,2015-01-03,"Many different things to like about this restaurant: (1) Reservations: the restaurant gets very crowded and waiting times can be very long, so reservations are a VERY good idea.  About 24 hours before we planned on eating, we originally made a reservation for 8.  But the numbers changed several times over the next day - first to 9, and then to 11.  Each time, the person answering the phone cheerfully changed our reservation without any problem (note - many of the tables at this restaurant are sort of ""communal"" affairs: long tables that can seat up to 20 or so, good deal for very large parties).  Additionally, although we showed up 20 minutes early for our reservation (and were initially told that our table wouldn't be ready until the actual reservation time), we were seated within 10 minutes. (2) Staff: our party of 11 included two different families and 7 children of various ages, none of whom seems to have conceded that you can't get EXACTLY what you want in a restaurant, even if it isn't on the menu.  Our waiter was incredibly friendly and dealt with all of our various requests without any complaints or difficulties.  For about two hours, every time he came to the table (which was often), he was asked to bring something else - show up with one coke; asked to bring two more.  We never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for him to show up, or for the table to be cleared after each course. (3) Food: this is the star of Jacob's Pickles.  I cannot think of one thing the 11 of us ordered (6 different appetizers, 7 different entrees, 4 sides, and 3 different desserts) that wasn't delicious.  Actual quote from my daughter: ""I don't usually like fried pickles, but these were great.""  Both my son and daughter tried the cheese grits (neither had ever had grits before) and loved them.  I am not a pancake fan, but the chicken and pancakes were amazing.  Frankly, I was disappointed I ordered the catfish tacos (which weren't bad, but weren't as amazing as everything else), because it meant I didn't have as much room to eat off of everyone else's plates.  Standouts for us included: fried pickles, biscuits & (sausage) gravy, chicken & pancakes, and sausage gravy smothered chicken.  Loved all of the desserts we ordered. Will definitely return.

The drinks at the bar are also really good, but could be a little larger for the money. Happy hour specials would be a nice addition to the menu too, but as of now, no happy hour exists. My only suggestion is to make sure when you make a reservation that they are able to accommodate it. Two weeks ago,  I made a reservation for over 8 people and I was told my party could have the long table in the front bar area. However, they seated another party there which resulted in my group being seated in three different sections of the restaurant. The staff did little to make up for the error and that really put a damper on our night.

Came here for brunch and had the Gouda grilled cheese (black bean hummus, jam, jalapenos, gouda) - it was spicy hot but delicious and came with a delightful mixed green salad. My boy had the cheddar and mozzarella grilled cheese with tomato soup which he very much enjoyed. The coffee was also spot on - nice and rich. The decor was super cool. Very chill, minimalist, hipstery. Dim lighting. Nice hearty wooden tables. Old timey coffee and draft bar area. Things that prevented me from giving this place a 5: wtf is with the service - food took forever to come out, the waitress kept trying to take our side of ice, had to ask for silverware. Also, the cider list. While it was comprehensive (they have A LOT of bottled and a few draft ciders), there were no normal, classic ciders. Each one felt like it was trying to one up the next and all had weird flavors that I didn't think belong in cider, so that's unfortunate. However, they have beer and wine, so it's not the end of the world. Another thing: it is VEGETARIAN, but I did not realize this and the food was awesome. Just don't come here expecting to get bacon with your brunch.

I like gastropubs because each one is different and unique. This one in particular is quaint. I like that the bar is almost a 360 bar and there's a lot of standing space. Came in when it opened and there was even a couple of people in there before they officially opened. haha. Looked at the menu and drinks. They have a very extensive list of whiskeys, which is really nice. They have craft beers and few interesting cocktails. I ordered the Spiked Cider (perfect getaway from the cold). Though my friend and I had to wait awhile for the cider to warm up, which is understandable since they technically just opened. From a small food menu, deciding what to eat was hard. First, we ordered the Boudin Style Meatball Skillet, which was flavorful and delicious. I really like the sauce that it was in too. Then, we both decided and ordered burgers except my friend added with bacon jam. The whole burger was delicious. Moist, juicy, flavorful. MMMM..... Really good. So the Bacon Jam needs a paragraph by itself because it was HEAVENLY. The alcohol may have gone to my head at the time, but how could you go wrong with bacon? The bacon jam is sweet and salty and quite addicting. So, after finishing our burger, and just finishing up our drinks. I was thinking what would be good with this bacon jam. So, someone came up to the bar and ordered fries (extra cripsy, which I didn't know that was a thing). And a light bulb lit up. YES, fries. So I asked the bartender if it was possible to do fries with bacon jam, and she's like I don't see why not. Yaay!! :D GET FRIES WITH BACON JAM. We also asked the bartender to recommend a whiskey because we're not too familiar with whiskeys and the type. Of course, with any alcohol, it's a personal choice of what you like. So, she asked if we like smokey, dry, spicy types of flavors. We said a nice smokey one would be good. Then she said the campfire, which we took her recommendation. It was good and smooth. Our visit here was very pleasant and relaxing. Great staff. I would love to come here for brunch one day, but I am hardly in the Upper East Side.

I can't say I've eaten out in New Haven all that much (aside from Pepe's) but Zinc really knocked it out of the park. To be fair though, they do charge Manhattan style prices, so it's a good thing the food stands up to the test. While we were there we tried a variety of apps and each of is had an entree. They do a really fantastic job with the pan-Asian style cuisine with a twist. The duck nachos were deadly good, I loved the use of crispy wonton skins instead of traditional nachos, it really elevated the dish. The steed dumplings weren't half bad either, but they didn't really wow. The lettuce wraps were also pretty decent but again nothing stellar, I would have happily ordered another round of nachos instead of either of those dishes. As far as entrees went, these were all knocked out of the park. The tuna was cooked exactly to specification (basically still breathing on the plate. The duck noodles were perfect, not too salty, which happens more than it should. I had the tofu curry dish which was more along the style of an Indian curry and was a pleasant surprise. All the entrees are quite large and very filling but you HAVE to save room for dessert. My friend and I each had the dessert special which was a creme brûlée with. A whiskey gelato and oh how I wish it had been a bigger serving, never mind the fact you had to roll me home. It was truly superb. The creme brûlée was perfectly cooked with just the right crust to cream ratio and the whiskey gelato perfectly captured the good flavors of whiskey without the harsh bite. They need to make it a staple! They also have a great cocktail list and wines by the glass or bottle. They also have a decent beers list but you have to ask, so if your server doesn't remember them all you may miss out on one. No biggie.

You had me at ""hello"" with your off-the-beaten path entry, stone walls, booth seating, homemade ketchup, whole berry jam and adorably friendly staff. If that's not enough to win you over, maybe the cranberry cream cheese with the banana bread or uniquely crispy and thinly sliced hash browns will do the trick? I would liken the space to a Boston basement bar turned 1800s Country Living Magazine cutesy. Ya know, curtains, wall art, plants - the feeling that you're in someone's house and you just know the food is bound to be delicious. As for pricing, be prepared for a $15 to $20 breakfast easily if you order a drink. I opted for the fresh juice and my companion the coffee. I would have to say my favorite dish was the hash browns - they were unlike any that I have had before. I guess you'll just have to try them for yourself to understand.

The hostess who took our names didn't seem to be able to read her own writing and was stumbling over everyone's names when she called them. It was FREEZING there (yes, I understand it's winter and it's a brick basement, but with all of the cooking and people, I expected I'd be able to take off my coat and have my layers (including a heavy sweater and scarf) be enough). There was a giant piece of dessert-bread mushed into the carpet at my feet. The vibe of the place is cute and charming, and the menu is full of tasty looking treats. We often bring guests here or meet up with friends for events, and we were there today because my in-laws remembered it fondly from another trip and wanted to visit again before they left town to return to AZ. I was hoping it'd keep a good reputation, but I was already a little worried before we arrived from memories of being slightly disappointed in recent visits with what I expected to be top notch meals...not a good sign. My dish was underwhelming, but okay. Our waitress was nice and kept the coffee coming. The fruit and cheese plate was fine, but not very inventive (there were a couple of what I suspect to be Cabot flavored cheddars that I had at home in my fridge). My Magnolia Eggs Benedict's hollandaise was a little too lemony and thin for my tastes (i love a touch of lemon, but overall, it lost it hollandaise-y-ness to me), and one of the eggs was almost hard-boiled, but overall the flavor was okay. The hash browns were stringy and undercooked, with a stronger taste of onion than I'd prefer (and I love me some fancy hash browns!), but the others at my table were plowing through theirs without problem, it seemed. I tried some of my husband's cinnamon-swirl french toast - it LOOKED amazing, but tasted dry and somewhat ""off"", which is weird for french toast (he felt he could do better, and he does make some mean french toast!). On the plus side, my father-in-law really liked the orange cranberry bread (and sorta got in trouble for not saying my mother-in-law's was better). :) Maybe all of the cooks were out late last night for NYE? Dunno, but I'm not all that enamored with this place anymore. It's a great little breakfast place (they do lunches, but we always go for breakfast) that we consider one of ""our places"", but I always end up a little disappointed - I want to love it more!

My friends and I were so excited to come here, after reading about it in various ""Best of Philly"" lists and great word of mouth from friends. We walked there on a cold evening, and our reservation was honored and table given to us within moments of our arrival (around 9pm on a Saturday). We got a little table right in the window overlooking the street, kind of separated from the rest of the restaurant which made it feel like we had our own private dining experience. Unexpected, but not unwelcome. Our server (I'm forgetting his name) was professional, charming, and friendly - everyone who served us was the same. The personalities we encountered were all down to earth and unpretentious. As for food (of course) I had the lamb prepared three ways, which I thought might not be too substantial (based on experiences at other restaurants) but my meal was very filling, and full of amazing flavors. I completely cleaned my plate. I also splurged on a dessert, a chocolate mousse (I think?) with sarsaparilla cream and bruleed cherries. After my first bite, I literally covered my mouth because it was so shockingly good and I felt like I was going to burst out laughing. I almost always regret getting dessert, but this was amazing. But what made the experience so wonderful was that they had a pianist (apparently filling in for someone else) who just didn't know how to play old standards. We listened to him plunk painfully through ""What a Wonderful World"" and some holiday songs, while occasionally playing some classical pieces flawlessly. We joked to the waiter about it, and found out that the pianist was a music grad student. It really did sound like he was doing his best and for some reason, the whole thing added a lot of warmth to the experience. It's nice to have a little humanity thrown into a meal. We all have our tough moments, and he was really trying. All in all, we loved it. I think one of my friends could have enjoyed his meal a little more, but I assume he can write his own review if it was that big an issue. I had a really great experience, and it made me genuinely excited about Philly's restaurant scene. Highly recommend to other out-of-towners.

Furthermore, Etka maintains reasonable prices especially when you consider the quality of food you receive...AND if you are a wine and dine person like myself you will be happy to know Etka is BYOB. The restaurant capacity is not very large with maybe a total of 8-9 tables...get there before 7pm and you should get a table. Finally the staff is very polite and friendly although they can be a little quiet/hard to hear when the restaurant is buzzing.   Overall highly recommend to anyone that enjoys Indian cuisine!

They'd be better off knowing how to handle the stress of maintaining the cash register and the food/drinks counter because you can obviously SEE their UNFRIENDLY looks on their faces. The unprofessional is obvious. Over the weekend, my father went there for sandwiches and the ladies were too busy tying ropes in the back to even bother to attend to customers. It wasn't until he got their attention that they did a damn thing. And speaking OF their counter, there's a tiny little section for customers to pile up the food they want to buy (not the orderable ones) on the counter. It's ridiculous, considering how many customers can be there at one time. Who's idea was to have the littlest possible section for the cash register line? Note: you can't even line up because the interior is so terrible. Now I don't come here just to make remarks about their customer service or decor because the food is okay in general. It's nothing special or remarkable, but decent if you're looking for a good bite to eat or a drink. They have a little section for hot food such as egg rolls, but I wouldn't recommend it. From the looks of it, they cook the egg rolls over and over and keep reselling them, which is why they have burnt black marks on the outer parts. I wouldn't even try anything else from that section if that's the way they're going with the food. Their sandwiches are alright and there is really no difference to how another place makes it. Bottom line - CRAP service, OK food

First of all, the dish called ""Pork & parmesan cheese over rigatoni"" did not even have the right pasta. It should be called ""3 cents pork that looks like vomit with ziti macaroni."" The dish was definitely not worth $19. Second, they did not offer the plates on the menu because they ran out of the ingredients and the mushrooms went bad. They shouldn't go on business if they can't serve that they state on the menu. BIG NO NO !! for mentioning that the mushrooms went bad; I could be a health inspector and shut down that place for violating a health code. Lastly, the service sucked! Bad waiters and waitresses. Terrible food!! An amateur chef or a teenager can make a better pasta! BUT the date cake was good, but they should rethink the whipped cream. Once again, the service and food were terrible, BUT the band and decoration was an A+.

When we sat down there was only seating by the bar, which was fine. However, one of us wasn't hungry and didn't want to order anything. The waitress told us bluntly and rudely that there is a requirement that each customer must purchase $8 worth of food per person. Even though my friends and I were ordering enough with entrees and appetizers that monetarily wise if worked out to over $32 total (4 people X $8 each), she was completely insistent and demanding that the 1 person not eating order something, even as a to-go item. That simply did not make any sense. After quickly using the bathroom, which also was very small, had soap that was all water mixed with a teeny dash of soap, we decided to head out. We ended up going to another ramen place in the area and the bill came to about $50. I still do not understand the logic behind the waitress's request but I won't ever return there because of that type of service, or lack thereof.

To be fair there was a small line forming outside. Ended up ordering the Shio Black Ramen. The soup base was mildly bland and on the greasy side. The ramen came with two small pieces of pork. The pork itself was very soft, fatty and melted in your mouth. It also has a nice smokey flavor that you rarely find at ramen shops but gave it a really nice flavoring. The pork was really good. The ramen noodles had a nice texture but wasn't anything special. We also ended up ordering their least dry warm sake (didn't ask for name) which was amazingly smooth and pleasant tasting.

364150,12329,3177,2.0,1,2015-01-02,"One final update for the third and final visit that I made to Bustan.  This time, after two relatively unsuccessful dinners, we stopped in for lunch to have the hummus and bread that we had enjoyed in the past.  I had high hopes that my previous reviews would no longer hold true, especially given all of the five star ratings here on Yelp. On this visit, we were already wary of the menu because of some previous misses, and so we stuck to the classics.  I also stuck to non-alcoholic beverages, this being lunch and all, although I did have fond memories of a previous fig lemonade cocktail.   The hummus bowl with lamb kebab ($17) had good hummus but the lamb was undercooked and had been seasoned with too much cumin.  The bread was good, however, extra bread will set you back $3.50.  The greek salad ($15) was good.  It could have done with a few more olives, but that is really my only criticism.  I would order it again, were I ever to return, which will be never. What really ruined lunch was the atmosphere in this restaurant.  The hostess was perfectly superficially nice.  However, there appeared to be only one waiter working the lunch shift, supported by numerous busboys and filled in here and there by a couple of guys who appeared to be restaurant management.  What that meant, beyond the indifference of the waiter, who no doubt had a lot to think about, was that the drinks and food took too long to arrive, and that nobody bothered to ask us once if we needed anything or even liked our food.  In the meantime, we were sandwiched in to a small table in a high traffic area. To top things off, the restaurant was playing club music at a rather high volume during lunch hour.  At one point, the lights were precipitously dimmed.  You might think, after reading other reviews about how ""sophisticated"" this spot is, that dimmed lights and techno would be appropriate.  However, were you to look around at the mostly sweatpant and sneaker-clad crowd that included strollers and small children, you would have laughed hysterically at the pretension of this place.  Being well-dressed makes one an outlier at this restaurant, at least at lunch hour.   I would have liked this place to have been a success, and a pleasant place to go for high quality food and a more upscale atmosphere than other spots in the vicinity.  Call me a hater and prove me wrong - shower and leave your sweatpants at home before dining at Bustan.  But don't expect great food or great service.

We started with some wine; a Syrah for him and a Pinot noir for me. For the meal, we were given these warm buttery, croissant-like rolls which I can eat a basket of and be happy with but they only have one per person. Honestly I wanted everything on the menu but landed on the foie gras appetizer, which was like a deconstructed peanut butter and jelly sandwich; except a million times better. For main, I had the Colorado lamb and the boyfriend had the pork belly. Both were superb, but I liked his dish more. I wasn't too crazy for the beans in mine. The star, however was the side of brussel sprouts with bacon stuffing. BLEW my mind. I am wiping away the drool off my keyboard as I type this. MUST get. For dessert, we finished with a light and refreshing lemon cake with pomegranate shaved ice. Overall a great place to dine. Will come again when I visit Philly!

Tip - for dinner, come between 5:30 and 6:30. You can get a prix fixe menu - 3 courses - for $35. In addition, it's not crowded at all during that time, whereas by the time we left at around 7:30 on a Saturday, the place was pretty packed. For dinner, I ordered the scallop crudo as an appetizer, heritage breed chicken for the main course, and the black forest chocolate torte for dessert. My friend also got the scallop crudo as an appetizer, the slow braised rabbit as the main course, and the butternut tart as the dessert. I tried all of these dishes and was completely floored by every single one. The scallop crudo was tasty and creative. It's super light and refreshing, and the toasted rice adds an interesting crunch. Also, they do not skimp on the scallops :) The chicken was also fantastic. Not overcooked at all - very juicy on the inside with a perfectly crispy skin. It came on a bed of super creamy/mushroomy tasting ragout. My friend's rabbit was also really great. Very tender - it tasted and felt meatier/fattier than rabbit usually tastes and did not offend my overly-sensitive-to-gaminess palate. Finally, the desserts, which are definitely not just an afterthought/obligatory menu item here. My friend's butternut tart was incredible. Very buttery, as to be expected, and doused with a sauce so delicious that she ate the sauce by itself. My chocolate torte is for serious chocolate lovers only. It is probably one of the richest/densest chocolate items I have ever had. I needed to balance it out ricotta it came with, but just totally impressive. Cafe Cluny is a pretty casual place, but the food that we had matched places that are much more formally acclaimed.

The authenticity is obviously out of the question, but it felt like I was having gas station sushi. The rice is well seasoned, but everything was very bland. I did appreciate the good prices including the 10% discount from yelp. It was only 20 bucks for three rolls and Gyoza!

They were one of the only places I could find that was open on New Year's Day (which wasn't super expensive) and I braved the crazy parade traffic to get there. The price for the lunch maki combo is unbeatable, I'd say. I usually do the Ken Shin maki combo since I can walk there from work, which is 9.95 for 2 rolls and soup/salad, so 3 rolls plus soup/salad for 10.95 is a steal. I got a spicy tuna, spicy salmon and spicy yellowtail--if you couldn't tell my favorite is a spicy roll, and usually spicy tuna is my go to. I agree with another review I read that I wish they didn't chop their fish and mix it in with the spicy mayo, etc. I'd much rather have an actual piece or hunk of fish with the other mix surrounding it. My rolls didn't have much of a kick, which was dissappointing. I also got too much of a fishy taste for my liking with the spicy salmon. By far it wasn't the worst sushi I've ever had, but I wasn't overly thrilled. I may try it again and maybe try some other rolls because I don't feel so bad having average sushi for that price, but I think I'll keep searching for a better sushi place near where I work.

If you want to go just to try it out for its historical background, go ahead but don't get your hopes up. You'll always find a better pie elsewhere and it's not in Soho. Oh and it's cash only so better find an ATM beforehand.

374809,192403,3237,3.0,1,2015-01-01,"I'm pretty picky when it comes to pizza. Actually, I would go so far to say that in all my years of travelling, I've only come across three pizzerias that get 100% of the components right: Tiramisu in Santiago de Chile, La Pizzeria in Campbell, CA and Da Napoli in my hometown Mannheim in Germany. But I digress... So after showing my parents Little Italy, we decided to go to Lombardi's for lunch. Wait for our party of 4 was 40 minutes (on New Year's Day around 3:30) - I guess still acceptable for New York standards (luckily, we could wait inside). It took a couple of minutes until our waitress showed up, who was very pleasant. We decided on two pizzas: one margarita (""red"") with pepperoni and one white with pancetta. Both were delivered relatively fast (15 min) and hot. As other reviewers have pointed out, the strong side of Lombardi's is definitely the crust and dough: Quite thin, chewy and slightly burned on the edges. The red one was definitely more flavorful, although they were a bit stingy on the salami pieces - on the whole pizza maybe 10 slices in total (they use these small pieces typical for American pizzas, not the larger salami you would find on ""authentic"" Italian pizzas.) The white pizza was very ""mild"" - not to say bland - and consisted mainly of cheese. They had put some pieces of pancetta, but it was not salty enough for my taste. Each pizza was around $25 plus another $4 for the meats. Given the small amount of pepperoni/pancetta they put on, certainly not cheap, but still okay. Together with drinks, tax and tip we ended up spending around $100 for four persons. Atmosphere is very authentic and service was good (cash only as others pointed out). So does Lombardi's pizza live up to the hype and justify a 40 min wait? Probably not, but it's one of the better options when you're in the area.

This was lacking in many other pizzas I have had. I wanted to get the SoHo square, but unfortunately they ran out. So instead, I got the pepperoni slice. It was greasy, but good. The pepperoni was so much better than the ubiquitous generic pepperoni flavor I am used to. It had a nice spicy little kick and it was salty, but not too salty. The sauce on both pizzas were flavorful and robust.

As soon as I got out of the Uber, holy crap, the line is LONG. But, here we go, getting in line before more people join the line, and mind you, it's only 6pm, 17 degrees outside, and there's about 20 people waiting outside, and this doesn't even include about 20 more people standing inside the tent leading down the stairwell. Little did I know, there's a sheet by the door that you're supposed to put your name on. As soon as that announcement was made, there was a mad rush into the tent for the sign up sheet. Being solo, it was quite a sad thing to announce in writing that I was a party of one. :( Little did I know, there's an upside to travelling solo. Not even a minute after, they called my name, WOO HOO! And let you tell you, many people definitely was jealous as I skipped about 10 parties in front of me and headed straight to the ramen bar for a bowl of the Mega Ramen + a tamago. First impression, the ramen bowl looked delicious and I was ready to dive my chopsticks and spoon in. First taste was the broth and it was amazing! Heavily seasoned chicken broth that was just warming, delicious noodles, and toppings. The Mega ramen came with more than enough char siu (pork meat) and I would sadly have to say this was my least favorite part of the meal. Everything earned a 5/5 whereas the meat is just a 3/5. I found the meat to be too dry and tough, lacking the soft, melt in the mouth tender pork that I'm used. But overall, still one of the best bowls of ramen I've ever had. Being located in such a narrow space, there was definitely a lot of run ins, but the staff was great, attentive and friendly. The price was also very reasonable when compared to Ippudo - you definitely get more food here + being in NY and all. Definitely recommend this ramen shop! TIP: - Add an egg to your ramen! - GET THERE EARLY and put your name on the sheet!

I am writing this review with his input as he has eaten much more ramen in his life then I have. First off, we got there at 12pm, when it first opens and already there was a long line. We were told we would have to wait 45mins for a seat, which turned out to be accurate. After we were sat, we ordered the miso ramen, paitan ramen, and two of the char sui bao. One woman on the end of the bar next to us ordered a little bit before. However, she got her order well before a group of four sitting behind us who came in and ordered 15 mins before. Because we were at the bar, we could see the way the orders were coming in and being made as well as the chefs cooking. it seemed that the orders were being filled in a random order rather than a first come first served basis, which we though was weird. Our food came and it was fine, but not worth waiting 45 mins for. To quote my boyfriend, his miso ramen was ""not bad."" Therefore, we are rating Totto 3/5 stars. I ordered a seasoned boiled egg and so did a girl next to me. hers was fired with a blow torch to become warm and gooey, mine was not. :( Lastly, on a side note. One of the chefs broke a bowl and the pieces spilled into a lot of the toppings boxes. The boxes were replaced as they were contaminated with the pieces of the bowl, which is obviously the right thing to do. However, my boyfriend then heard the owner tell the chef (in japanese) to put less toppings on the ramen from then on to make up for the cost of the bowl. wtf?! talk about cheap!

I tried two Reds-an Italian Valpolicella (Corvina) and South West French.  I thoroughly enjoyed both vins; they were very good complements to our cheese plate.  Outside of the wide selection of French & Italian wines, Amelie offers wine from just about everywhere else-South Africa, Germany, Austria, Spain, Greece, Chile, Portugal, California, you get the picture.   The Cheese plate was fantastique!  A lover of all cheese, i couldn't make a damn decision so i asked our lovely Frenchman to give us the three most popular options.  He did not disappoint, i almost ate all the rind as well.  The Brie is very creamy (possibly a triple cream?), and the presentation of the Swedish cheese was simply divine.  It was shredded and rolled up in a shape resembling a carnation.    The plate came with grapes, candied walnuts, marmalade & honey and dried figs & prunes.  OH and the bag of baguette!!!  One of the best things France has to offer, and more enjoyable than an afternoon in Versailles, are my memories sitting on a park bench in Paris, eating French bread to the face.   At the end of our night at Amelie, i felt compelled to stop by a liquor store and Whole Foods to buy more wine and cheese (God forbid a belly full of wine and cheese is abated)!

384987,18065,3265,4.0,1,2015-01-01,"I never thought I would find a funkadelic French Bistro, but alas I find myself saying I wish there were more funkadelic French Bistros in the world especially in Denver.   French food is always our go to cuisine for a great meal and Amelie hit the spot perfectly. Amelie offers classic French food with a modern atmosphere and 70's music filling the space.  Throughout the meal I found myself singing along with the music and doing my very best Donna Summer impression. HH is definitely where to start at Amelie.  HH is served in the entire dining room and worth a look before ordering off the main menu.  Everything sounds delectable and we wanted to taste a little bit of everything so we ordered more appetizers and shared an entrée. Bruschetta - Goat cheese and roasted red peppers (from HH menu) Mussels with white wine and butter Escargot in garlic butter (from HH menu) Duck Confit with fingerling potatoes and mushrooms Basket of French bread Wine Flights (from HH menu) The Bruschetta was forgettable and if dining at Amelie again I would forgo the Bruschetta and have two orders of the Escargot.  The Escargot were buttery garlic flavor bombs served piping hot.  The crusty French bread was needed so I could soak every last drop of garlic butter and savor my love of butter.  The Mussels were prepared with white wine, fennel, and garlic and were as addictive as ever.  We were served a heaping pile of Mussels (more than enough for two) that were plump and delicious and disappeared as quickly as they arrived.   The Duck Confit was a show stopper.  Everything on the plate was divine, from the crispy duck skin (AKA - Crack), the bite size fingerling potatoes, and the earthy mushrooms.  I could have easily licked the plate clean but opted to be a lady instead.  Next time I'll be licking the plate, so when you see someone picking up a plate and licking every last morsel of tasty goodness you'll know it's me (come say hi). Amelie has a modern French romance vibe and is a wonderful dining destination for couples.  The front of the restaurant can be lively and loud so I would request a seat in the back for a more intimate dining experience.  Reservations are recommended if not required if you want to be seated for dinner.  From the atmosphere to the food this funkadelic French Bistro is deliciously trendy and only becomes more mouthwatering as Donna Summer plays in the background... Last dance Last chance for love Yes, it's my last chance For romance tonight I need you by me Beside me, to guide me To hold me, to scold me 'Cause when I'm bad I'm so, so bad So let's dance the last dance Let's dance the last dance Let's dance this last dance tonight

I was imagining that their special with 6 oysters and a beer, white or red wine for $8 would be a fantastic deal, but when I tasted their white wine, I retracted that assumption.  I tried two of their wines that night, and both of them tasted like a headache (were too sweet and light).  A restaurant that serves, well, Fish should offer its customers better wine to go with their seafood.  It's such a shame that it really was bad.  It saddened the whole meal.

We came for the first time for dinner last night and adored it instantly. The decor is fresh, simple, uncluttered but stylish and inviting. The wine list is small, well-chosen, and very affordable. The Rosso Toscana we picked for $32 was everything a Tuscan red should be- silky and smooth- and complemented the meal perfectly. We had a really hard time choosing what to eat because the menu, and the long list of specials, all sounded so good. You have a lot of options in terms of lighter or more hearty, Grandma-style fare, so it should be amenable to most everyone. I noticed that they have whole wheat and gluten-free pasta on request if you choose it. We did not, and are going to make another trip to try out their homemade pasta next time. Much like the decor and the frank, prompt, and unpretentious service, the food is just flat-out, no b.s. good. The vitello, served Milanese-style, was breaded and fried just right, with a wonderful tomato salad on top. Their meatballs are velvety, in a bowl full of marinara that you want to drink, with a dollop of ricotta and basil ribbons that put the whole thing over the top. Their salads were great, even the side of broccoli was perfectly cooked- not overdone, really green with a hint of garlic and lots of fresh lemon to squeeze. We were eating off the effects of the night before, as it was New Year's Day, so we went for heavier things, but the only regret I have was that I didn't get the branzino special, too, which was roasted skin-on and elegant beside a beautiful tangle of baby arugula, glistening with good olive oil. I don't usually write such long reviews, but we enjoyed our night so much there that I wanted to make sure I gave a more detailed description. We've had much costlier meals that weren't half as good, for that alone I would encourage you to go try it. We are already planning our return. :)

At first glance, Black Tree is nothing special - cramped, loud, bordering uncomfortable - but if you're part of the lucky dozen that gets table service and a raw, yet knowledgeable server, the place grows on you, fast. Starting with a seafood artichoke dip, bacon wrapped brussel sprouts, and into entrees such as fish tacos, massive po' boy sandwiches and cubanos it's quite evident that you don't have to travel far to get great, locally sourced meat and produce. As hip as it is to call yourself a regionally friendly establishment these days, they do a great job of blending it in, starting with the food and ending with their beer selection. I would recommend this place to anyone.

And think twice about sitting near the front door in cold weather; when the tiny kitchen overheats, the door gets propped open. Tacos were not bad, but so overloaded with filling that the tortillas were too soggy to pick up. That's not how you make tacos. Burratta from Di Faro's in Little Italy was totally decent, but our portion was covered with too much salt. And I like salt. Serve salt and pepper on the side. Brussels sprouts were okay, but if you get ones close to the size of ping pong balls, cut them in half! They cook better that way and are easier to eat--especially when everything is served on wood planks. Bottom line, Black Tree has very good intentions but very little finesse.

First impression was good.  The place was welcoming and had good ambiance.  We were seated quickly and the hostess was friendly.  Few minutes later hostess comes back as our waitress.  I noticed some cocktails were $9 and some were $24.  To me that either means some are sharable fishbowls or some are top shelf.  I asked the waitress what sizes the cocktails come in and she just stared at me.  So I clarified, asking in terms of ounces.  More awkward staring and she finally said she didn't know.  Ok.  No offer to walk 10 feet over to the bar and find out.  Cool.  I guess I'll be surprised when I order this Margarita... Got the perfect margarita and boyfriend got some pineapple thing.  Mine was strong but not great.  I wasn't a fan of his, but whatever.  Not my drink.   We got the build your own guac and the red snapper ceviche as starters.  The guac was perfect.  Seriously great.  That's about it.  The ceviche was plated well and visually appealing, but that's it.  I took one bite and said ""nope"".  Boyfriend finished it because he was starving but didn't love it.  It was a bit overpriced, and tasted more like a seafood salad than a ceviche.  It really missed the light fresh flavors that are meant to come with citrus and onion and just felt heavy and overly fishy.  Not how I prefer ceviche, which is something we eat once every few weeks.  (I will point out that we didn't complain and it was gone when she collected the plates, so she likely had no idea we weren't satisfied and if you don't speak up, they can't fix it, so that's on us) I was going to order the fish tacos but learned they were out.  Was thinking about the lamb but they were out of that too.  After that I felt pressured to order so I just got a salad thinking it would be pretty hard to screw up.  Wrong again.  It looked like it would have been great if it had a different dressing and base.  The toppings (tomato, radish) were fresh and looked good but the spinach/lettuce was a bowl of wilted soggy slop.  I really wasn't a fan of the dressing; probably should have gotten it on the side.  Tried my boyfriends' spicy tacos.  Got no spice (and I'm a weenie when it comes to spices usually).  Ordered a different cocktail, something with jalepeno.  It was just ok.  Not bad but not great.   I felt like there was a lot of time where we were just sitting & waiting for her to come back.  They weren't terribly busy but I think she was the only server; didn't see anyone else. At nearly $100 for 2 of us I don't think we'll be back.

The decor was really nice and the bar setup was really cool. From the start our waitress was a bit off. She didn't know the size of the signature drinks (one would assume the $10 drink might be smaller than the $28 one. But it might just be the liquor). After we decided on our food, we were told the items we were considering were sold out (would of been nice to not get our hopes set and then be told it was sold out). Ordered the custom guacamole and red snapper ceviche. The guacamole is the only thing that made this review a 2 star review. I've made ceviche many times before. There was a very strong fish taste that not the guacamole, drinks or my entree could remove. Even as I write this I feel like I licked fish scales. GF got the salad which was bleh, dressing was bland. I got the short rib tacos. Short rib tasted like they took it out of a pot roast dish (no mexican seasoning) and the taco was impossible to hold as it was just too wet with the corn/cream topping. Our waitress never once came over to ask how the apps or even the entree were. But again, guacamole was good, if that's all you're looking for.

My intended destination was closed for the holiday, so I rounded the corner and ran smack into this place. It's too small. Way too tiny inside. 4 people were in line and 2 were eating at the 2 counter spots and it was already too cramped. So underwhelming. My problem starts with the dough. The crust is minimal if not nonexistent. The weird line between thin crust and regular. But the selection was large enough, and I liked that they offered a truffle and mushroom pizza. Not ordinary, and I thought it might mean they were confident in their abilities to select ingredients. Not so. The cheese seemed normal enough, though I doubt it's truly ""flown in weekly"". I had the dry sausage pizza. It was indeed dry. But when it says ""hot"" sausage, don't make it mild. Lame. I ended up dumping roughly an entire bottle of red pepper flakes to spice it up. Nothing saved it. So many better places in the city and right around the area even. Go elsewhere unless you love average squarely-sliced pizza

Ambience: Very beautiful place. The decor is on point with art work all over. It has low lighting with candles to create a relaxed mood. There was a live band playing last night that was very enjoyable. There is a ""VIP"" section in the back and by the back I mean the back and around a corner! It's good for private events and business meetings! The Staff: Our waitress was everything. She expressed that she wasn't prepared to be waiting that night so if she seemed off forgive her. Well she was on point and very attentive! She laughed and joked with us and stayed on top of everything. Thank you Shaniece! Besides our waitress others came to check on us and they were very friendly as well. Vonda the owner stopped by our table quickly as well! The Food: Biscuits and cornbread come out while you wait for your food and they are GOOD! We gobbled up all the bread and begged for more! Each of us ordered different things from the menu. Gumbo, smothered turkey wings(huge portion) the blueberry ribs, catfish platter and homemade turkey burger! Everyone throughly enjoyed their plates. The seasoning, the sauces, the taste was all great. No take home boxes needed! My only complaint with the food is the Mac and Cheese, it was regular. Not all that great. I think being from the South I set my standards to high for Mac and cheese. Maybe it will improve! My slice of red velvet cake was good! Not the best but good! Price: The prices are fairly decent. Be careful with the sides if they don't come with your meal they will charge full price for substituting. Prices for plates range from about 8$-25$ which is not bad at all. The drink prices are pretty standard for drinks up here $10-$14+ depending on the drink. Shots of Ciroc are 10! Overall: it's a great place to visit. The atmosphere is prefect for a chill night! And the band is awesome as well.   They lost a star because we had a choice of where to sit, where we could see the band or in VIP where we would not see the band. The wait for the band area was 1hr the wait for VIP was 15min so we picked VIP.  We waited the 15 mins, but after times was up we were told the wait would be an additional 10 mins.  We ended up waiting 40 mins for the VIP section. The hostess led us to our table which was not ready for us so we had to wait a little longer to have it cleaned! There is always room for improvement and I will definitely be back!

I tried the pho with beef balls and raw meat. I was curious about the beef balls but they were general meatball things sliced from a sausage looking thing. Yea, not sure what it was so I don't know if I would recommend it, but it was tasty. Pho was pretty good, but to me, pho is how you doctor it not how it comes to you. Came pretty tasty so that's cool. Service was pretty good, water was constantly flowing as were napkins (so necessary with pho). But I think we had like 3 waiters at a time so it was difficult to figure out who to ask for things. I was a little bummed when I asked for a thai bubble tea at the end and didn't end up getting it. But the whole dinner for two was $13. I'll def come again. On the other hand, I've been here before (about a yr ago) and got noodles and other delicious foods and found myself suuuuuuuper satisified.

Do get: Any roast meat but especailly the roast pork and duck. The baby pig, the one with the crunchy skin (Lechon for all you Pinoy's) is an instant foodboner for me. ""That soup with the roast duck"". Yes, that's how I order it and somehow, nothing gets lost in translation. Beef pan fried noodles. Crispy noodles! Strange chewy ""beef"".

Tip'em cheap or don't tip them if they piss you off that bad. Even if they yell at you for not tipping them, they won't remember you, because they think all white and black people look alike! If you're Asian I wouldn't suggest this, however. Just remember doe: it's bad karma not to tip. look into the open kitchen or the guy cutting up the meat.

The first time, I tried ordering food and thought he didn't hear what I ordered - only because he didn't acknowledge that he did.. and so after I repeated it, he raises his voice and responds ""I HEARD YOU"". The second time was on NYE of this year, just 3 days ago. This same nasty waiter wouldn't even let all of us in the door! I tried walking in to see if there was a wait for a table for the group of us and he says ""WE ARE NOT SERVING YOU. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE"". Holy shit!

My cheesesteak, omg was amazing! I have never eaten a whole steak in one sitting, but I could not put this heaven in the form of a roll down.  I wanted to snap a pic for you guys, but before I knew it it was gone, first of all the smell that filled the car while I drove home was orgasmic, then to finally take a bite... wow, it was worth the wait.  Simply amazing... So a week later I find myself in the area again, my insides are doing the happy dance, so excited.  I go in and as hard as it was to not order a regular cheesesteak, I did it for the sake of a inclusive review, I ordered a chicken cheesesteak with spinach.  Again I meant to take a picture, but when I opened the wrapper and saw the huge chunks of wonderfully seasoned chicken, my hands reached for the steak, not the phone, and before I knew it again it was gone.  It's hard to believe that the two sandwiches were from the same place, not that they weren't good, but the chicken had such a fresh taste, I wasn't expecting from the same place as the perfectly greased cheesesteak I had the week earlier.  I actually felt like with the chicken I was eating healthy.  I was pleased both times, and will be back... often. Also the service both times was nice and friendly, I didn't feel rushed while deciding what to top my cheesesteaks with.  The ticketing system for the pick up is a nice touch although both times, I didn't know where I put the tickets once I got my change, but luckily it wasn't a problem since they weren't crowded.  Next time I'll be trying their cheese fries which I hear are amazing.

I am in the minority opinion amongst Yelpers since everyone seems to go gaga over this unkosher restaurant that serves American small plates but simply put, I was disappointed, twice non the less. The meal definitely had some high points, but after the first set of rounds, which were respectable, it quickly went down hill after the 5th to 10th plates. If the first round stayed consistent throughout the meal, a 4 star review would apply, but this was not the case. For the food, I will list the order in which the food came out. Also, the service does earn a point of mention since they were so friendly and welcoming and I feel they went above and beyond for my friend who has a soy allergy. They were able to accommodate her and accommodate her well. The food: Strawberry-Cinnamon glazed Berkshire baby back ribs- Reg menu. This is kind of their go to dish. I ordered this on both visits and truth be told, they were just regular tender ribs, and I also didn't get a strawberry note at all. It also bothered me that the ribs weren't hot but lukewarm. It's a pretty dish but I don't see the hype. Sweet & Sour pork belly, Korean chile paste, quince, pineapple, haricots- Xmas menu. It was a nice dish, it was a sizable dish and the pork belly was tender, but I felt it should have been a little more tender and should have had a tad bit more fat. It didn't have the unctuousness I expect from pork belly. I also wish there was some type of exterior crust on the pork belly. The flavors were good but could have been tweaked. Lettuce, mac apples, grapes, bacon, blue cheese, sunflower, pomegranate- Reg menu. This dish stood throughout the night as my favorite dish. It seems absurd for me to enjoy salad so much, but it was a testament to how great the salad was. The salad was so wonderfully sweet and savory. The greens were dressed properly, the apples offered a nice crunch, the grapes and pomegranate added a wonderful sweetness and there was a amazing underlying blue cheese note throughout the salad that was fantastico. And crispy bacon needs no mention lol Stir-fried Mongolian lamb tongue, cumin,Szechuan peppercorns- Xmas menu. The lamb tongue was so insanely tender, no teeth required, but the flavor was just OK for me. I didn't think this dish was that memorable and there was no heat what so ever from the peppercorn. I thought the sauce was too overpowering and gloppy and the tongue taste was lost, it seemed like it was only there for texture. Spicy bigeye tuna tartare, tempura Japanese, eggplant, kecap manis- Reg menu. This dish had no heat, the tuna had good flavor but the eggplant did not have a pleasant texture. The eggplant was too soft and not really crunchy, it was also greasy to boot. The tuna by itself was nice, the bottom, not so much. Joe's chopped chicken livers, balsamic-bacon toasts, rosemary & shallots- Reg Menu. I was super excited to try this dish, but sadly, it was one of my least favs. It really didn't resemble chopped liver at all, the flavors were so mild and the toast was a bad choice, the toast was too thick and the balsamic was too sweet, not a pairing that worked for me. Dayboat scallops, butternut squash risotto, huckleberry, pistachio, sage- Reg menu. The scallops were cooked well, super soft and tender, a tad under for me, but the risotto bothered me. I was expecting a little bite from the rice but it seemed more like pumpkin rice pudding than risotto The texture of risotto usually has some type of a chew to the rice, the rice in this dish was soft throughout. Spicy garlic roasted eggplant & crispy sweetbreads, arbol chillies- Xmas menu. This was essentially General Tso's chicken. The dish was too sweet for me, the heat was OK but the sweetbreads, which are normally creamy and milky, were completely lost when it was fried and submerged in the overpowering and overly sweet General Tso's sauce. The fact that it was sweetbreads didn't help at all, they could have easily used chicken and it wouldn't have changed the flavor at all. Crispy whole-fried flounder, curry-coconut sauce, Chinese sausage- Xmas menu. This dish bothered me a lot. First, the overpowering smell of the curry was too much. Second, the coconut was so unpleasantly flavored and way too sweet. Third, the fish was overcooked and dry, while being greasy. The fish wasn't really crunchy either, it was basically limp and it looked that way when it was put on the table. I knew when I saw it, I wasn't going to like it. Lastly, I did not like the Chinese sausage they used. It almost seemed like a fake Chinese sausage or Costco brand. Five-spice layer cake, yuzu, sesame, coconut- I thought this was a nice finish to the meal. It was light and refreshing, the coconut ice cream had nice flavor and the yuzu offered a nice refreshing tartness. The cake was a tad dense though.

She told me about this place and we walk over... yes she's cool to live close by in this amazing neighborhood... we walk in and were seating considering we did not have reservations!  Lucky Us!  The ambiance would be my only complaint... way too dark... it was so dark (black ceilings) that I could barely see my food and see the presentation!  Anyway, we ordered several dishes and I think their dishes change often, ... but here are some of the dishes (I may be off with some of the ingredients since its been a few months now). Sauteed broccoli rabe, portabello mushrooms, truffle toast, fried egg, aged asiago, this was okay, I felt it was a bit heavy and sloppy to eat.   Foie gras served with crostini and some sweet spread (sorry can't remember what it actually was) but this was bar far my favorite.. it was like eating silky peanut butter!   Scallop (or ? sorry I have photo though) w/seaweed (very fresh and melted in mouth),  white fish (hamachi neck I think), w/spring zucchini (another favorite). Pan seared scallop and risotto ( scallop was a little over cooked and risotto was heavy). Drinks, I had some type of mojito that was off the chain.. it was spicy and I loved it!  My friend had a chocolate type cocktail that was also quite refreshing!  I think over all I would like to come here again to try other dishes such as their pork dishes as it is their specialty but yes, my friend doesn't eat pork so we refrained from the other goodies.  For the most part, I enjoyed my experience although some of the dishes were a bit of a miss, but again, I think if I had tried some of their other dishes, I may have been more pleased.  I'll still give it 3.5-4 stars.

My husband got steamed dumplings which were good as well but the pan-fried is definitely the way to go. My husband loved the sesame pancake so much that he ordered another one as soon as we finished the first. I came back a second time because I wanted to do a taste test of all of the top rated / most talked about dumpling places in the area. I went to 4 including Prosperity again and Prosperity surpassed them all. I ordered the pan-fried pork and chive dumplings at all places. This time I also ordered the sesame pancake with pork inside and it literally changed my life! Perfectly warm and chewy and crunchy and soft and salty with fresh veggies and slightly sweet pork inside. I will be dreaming of this. Definitely worth the wait even in the cold. It is a tiny spot so be prepared to get your food to go or if a spot opens up, sit at the counters on the sides with people squished in hovering over you. Also it is cash only.

Well, I am so GLAD I did because they did not disappoint. They were so delicious, and moist and the touch of soy sauce and hot sauce just upped the flavor. I also ordered the vegetable dumblings which are boiled. They were not as tasty but still very good. With the remaining dumplings, I went home, through some oil into a hot pan and sautéed the others. Simply delicious! And for 5 dollars, you can't go wrong. Oh, I also ordered frozen dumplings to cook at home for when it strikes me.

As I pulled over, I looked up and saw that I was parked in front of none other than the famous Prosperity Dumpling! Friends had mentioned it, I'd seen the thousands of reviews on Yelp. I made a mental note to come here for lunch. After mentioning this to my client in conversation, he said ""YES. If you work here, you're required to OD on Prosperity."" Believe the hype, peeps. For $3.50, I had a most filling lunch (pork dumplings + the sesame pancake with duck). Best dumplings I've ever had, and the sesame pancake was a delight of fried bread, meat, and veggies (the cilantro pleasantly surprised me!) I picked more up the next day to bring home, and it traveled back to Queens decently enough...but let's be honest, you're going to go here and then go sit in the park and stuff your face with this shit. You can't sit down here (I mean, you can, but there will already be people on the few stools they have), and it looks like the place that you most definitely would not want to get food from, but ya'll need to trust Yelp on this one.

I'm vegetarian and the veggie burrito is always delicious and you can just taste how incredibly fresh the vegetables are. I'm sure other vegetarians know that not all veggie burritos are created equal, sometimes it's just all rice and beans with a few measly pieces of oily or undercooked zucchini, an afterthought on a mostly carnivore centric menu... not the case at De Mole. It's fresh, tasty and not at all oily. For the vegans you can substitute for vegan cheese and vegan sour cream. They also have a lot of other vegetarian and vegan options, but I'm a creature of habit and I always get my favorite. The Guacamole is delicious and the reasonable portion comes with a mild, creamy tomato dipping salsa and somehow never enough chips. The food isn't super spicy but they always ask how you would like it prepared and they do have homemade sauces to add to your taste. The prices are reasonable and it's probably my favorite restaurant in Sunnyside because it's so consistently fresh and I always leave full and satisfied. The only reason I'm taking off a star is that they do not serve hard liquor... so no margaritas. They do have a full selection of reasonably priced beer, wine and even sangria.

Why else the bride in dress and bouquet leaving at the same time we did  -- or the staffing, both kitchen and wait staff, was insufficient . It took 4.45 hours for our 4 course, not inexpensive meal to be delivered to us and needed one of us to get up twice to find a manager to expedite things. Although he was very apologetic and reassuring that our entree which we waited almost an hour for would be along in just a few minutes, he nor the wait staff ever returned to see if it was all right or whether we needed additional drinks. The waitress reappeared after entree plates were cleared with dessert spoons, never asked if we wanted coffee  or an after-dinner drink. Once dessert came, we asked for check immediately. The whole idea of early reservation was to be able to do other things the balance of the evening. Before we left we spoke with the manager again who really began to espouse our complaints as a personal affront. Not the intention. We saw it as huge waste of money, meals, drinks, taxes, tip around 1 k and a very disappointing holiday experience. The bright notes of the evening were the 6 pm fireworks and the fact that none of our coats were in a jumble of the coat room.

We started off with a 9:00 pm reservation and arrived a bit early. We were seated right away and that was the only thing good that happened during the evening. The waitress took a long time to greet us and take a drink order. We had to ask for water while we were waiting for drinks. When the drinks came 45 minutes later, they only brought 3 of them and said one couldn't be made because they had no more clean shakers to make the martini. We waited over 20 minutes for that 4th drink to arrive. After this hour of waiting with no drinks, the waitress finally took our order for our meals and left. again. We had to ask for water again as well as plates for our bread and we were ready for another round of drinks by this time. It would have been great to have that second round but we were never even asked if we wanted anything else to drink at that point. We had servers starting to bring out appetizers & soup and unfortunately they didn't speak English very well so we couldn't even figure out what they were trying to serve us. There was barely any time given between the appetizer and the soup/salad course. The table hadn't even been cleared of any dirty dishes or the glasses from our first round of drinks. The lobster bisque was served from a small pitcher and barely covered the bottom of the bowl and was only just warm, not hot. Our meals came out fairly quickly after that and we hadn't even been checked on by the waitress for more drinks. (yes, we've had one drink in over 2 hours). The meals were not up to par - filet mignon was cooked incorrectly, the short ribs were cold. When we finally got the waitress's attention, we didn't want anything other than another drink. But the second round of drinks was even more of a fiasco. They had no more martini glasses - brandy snifters were used. They got two of the drinks wrong - one shaker only poured out about a 1/2 inch martini and the other just tasted terrible. The person who was supposedly the GM of the restaurant came over and tried to remake the martini and made it worse. It was actually just pathetic. At this point, it was after 11:00 and we had been there over 2 hours. We were served one drink, given a second round of terrible drinks, served incorrect meals and cold food. We had to ask for water and dishes and for the table to be cleared. At this point, we needed to get dessert out of the way and get up to the deck for fireworks. The waitress made sure we knew there was a dessert buffet on the deck. We went ahead and ordered coffee to come out with the dessert. Amazingly, they were able to serve us cold coffee and the desserts were completely not what was expected. The creme brûlée was served cold and not fired on top with that tasty glaze. I guess it was supposed to go with the cold coffee.  Mr. GM Of the Restaurant started getting very nasty at this point and seemed surprised that we had an issue paying a bill for $175 per plate, an automatic 20% gratuity plus a round of drinks that we never really ended up getting let alone drinking. He was very willing to take the servers tip off of the bill to make it up to us instead of discounting our meal. I feel that the only reason he even ended up taking money off the bill is because I called him out in front of the waitress to let her know that his idea to fix the problems with his restaurant was to take her tip off the bill so we would be happy. She didn't even know what to say. He adjusted our bill to the early seating price after that conversation which still ended up being over $700 for a 4 course meal for 4 people that no one could eat. Thank goodness we got a limo for the evening so that we could go home sober and hungry!

We were told we had to wait, understandable. After we got seated to our table, our waitress came over about 20 minutes later to take our drink order, we had a party of four. drink orders came out, minus mine. after approx. 15 min or so mine came out with an apology. Waitress stated they were very busy. Well its New years, I would expect they would be busy and have extra staff, that was not the case. Saw other people complaining. Drink was wrong and when asked for another one was told they did not have any shakers that were clean, on top off that the proper glasses were not used, martini drinks were put in bourbon glasses. Asked for it dirty with blue cheese, was received just olive juice and undrinkable. was starving at this point as we already placed our order but again was 2 hours late. We only ate the 4 pieces of bread on the table and the lobster bisque. Our waitress we saw 2 times in 2 hours. had one glass of water, no refill no drinks and no food. After 2 and half hours our food came and was not what I ordered, on top of that it was over cooked and none of us even had the proper utensils to eat with. At this point midnight is approaching and we got the package deal. Asked numerous times to speak to the manager and was told an adjustment would be made. Well lets just say the adjustment was them taking off the waitress tip that was 20 percent of the bill. We were not told tip would be added when reservations were made. I have eating in many restaurants and have never had tip added unless it was a party over 6, we had 4. The manager came over with an attitude and we explained this was the worst experience ever. They even messed up the dessert. The crème brulee was cold, never heated up or fired up. The manager took only one hundred dollars off, and said he would do no more. He literally threw it on our table. I reluctantly paid for this meal, only because I did not want to get charged with theft. The package deal which included the fireworks was another joke. There were no heated tents and we were so late getting to top deck we missed most of the display. I am disputing this bill with my credit card company, and I can only hope Moshulu will make things right. If not we will seek a more drastic course. Please anyone who had a bad experience that night call your credit card company, call the owner. If we all stick together maybe we will get our money back. As far as the memories of ringing in the new year we will never. By the way the peanut butter sandwich at 2am was the best sandwich I ever had.

399011,200644,3343,1.0,-1,2015-01-02,"This is the first time I have taken the trouble to write a negative review for a restaurant, but our experience was so horrible, that if hadn't cost us almost $1000 it would have ""almost"" been comical.  We had 9:30 reservations for 4 for NY Eve.  When the reservations were made we had been told that they had an open menu, and that for an additional fee of $25 each, we could go upstairs after dinner to watch the fireworks and enjoy a dessert buffet.  We arrived at approximately 9:20.  Our table wasn't ready so we went to the bar and bought a round of drinks. Right then we should have known we were going to have a problem as there was a bit of confusion with my sister's drink order. (She ordered a martini which I would think is a pretty standard drink.)  We were seated about twenty minutes later.  This is when the real trouble started.  We sat down and ordered drinks.  When we received the menu, we noticed that it was not an open menu as we had been told, but a prix fixe menu of $175 per person, exclusive of drinks.  We asked our server about this, but she informed us that was the only menu they were offering that night.  We also talked to the manager on duty...he apologized and offered us some complimentary drinks for the miscommunication. We had already ordered our drinks so we waited for them.  And waited.  The server came to take our dinner order...we mentioned the drinks we were still waiting for...she said they would be up shortly.  Yet still we waited.  We received our appetizers, yet still no drinks. It was only after we complained yet again to the manager did we receive our drinks, which by this point was almost an hour after we had ordered them, and after we had already finished our apps.  The manager was nice enough to offer us complementary sparkling wine, which was very good, but didn't quite make up for the issues so far. We did make it clear that we didn't blame the waitress up to this point as it was quite evident that this was a bar problem,  Not that there was a throng around the bar...there was hardly anyone at the bar....the problem was there didn't appear to be anyone behind it either.  But wait...there's more.  Our soups were brought out, but three out of the four of us did not have spoons.  (I also didn't have any forks, but my sister was kind enough to offer me one of hers for my earlier appetizer)  When our soups were served we did inform the server that we needed spoons.  So we waited.  And waited.  The manager walked by and asked us how our food was...when we informed him we were waiting for spoons he did make the spoons appear.  By this time our soups were cold.  I had the lobster bisque, which might have been good if it hadn't been cold and also quite salty.  Eventually our main courses arrived.  The server served everyone what they ordered and as he was puttiing my dish in front of me he said ""salmon"".  I didn't order salmon.  I told him I ordered artic char not salmon...so he said yes, artic char and put down the dish.  It was salmon.  I'm not a huge fan of salmon, but given our experience up to this point I didn't even bother to send it back. I don't know if it was just a mistake in the kitchen or a substitution that I wasn't told about. I took a bite of the salmon but that was about it....most of it was left on the plate.  The pureed cauliflower that is was served with was very tasty, but not worth being the main course for a $175 meal.  By this point it's 11:40 and our waitress suggested that rather than have coffee and the dessert included with the meal at the table, that we go upstairs to partake of the dessert buffet so that we wouldn't miss the fireworks.  We decided to take her suggestion...she brought our bill which had a 20% gratuity already included...no where did it mention that a gratuity would be automatically included....and which totaled OVER $900 just for the four meals.  For the record, we normally tip over 20% for decent service and well over 20% for good service, so the 20% wasn't the problem, but the 20% for the service we had received was.  Also, the fact that they didn't offer any sort of discount for having to forgo dessert due to their service issues was a bit disappointing.  To add insult to injury, we went upstairs and there were no desserts left at the dessert buffet!  I realize that service on a night such as NY eve may be a bit slower than a non-holiday night, but to have SO many issues is astounding. They obviously did not adequately staff for the evening, and some of the staff they did have was obviously incompetent. Other than the salty soup, and substituting salmon for artic char, the food had some promise.  I assume dessert would have showed promise as well, but we can't really attest to that since we didn't get any.  The only saving grace to my evening not being a complete fail was the company I was with. My husband owns a small business and we were considering holding an upcoming company dinner at the Moshulu...or at least we WERE.

When we made our reservation over the phone, we were told it was a regular dinner menu that evening.  When we sat down for our 9:30 reservation we were given a $175 pre-fixe menu.  The manager apologized and offered us two rounds of complementary drinks.  It was all downhill from there... We did not receive a single drink from the bar for 50 minutes after sitting down.  At this point, we called the manager over again to complain about the delay.  He brought us a bottle of champagne which was a nice gesture, but not what we wanted.  Our first course actually came out before our drinks.  After that we were served soup without spoons.  It took the server 10 minutes to get us spoons and by then, our soups were cold.  When our entrees arrived, my sister was served Salmon although she ordered arctic char. Because the service was so slow, we did not have enough time to enjoy the fourth course (dessert) because it was midnight and we wanted to watch the fireworks.  Our server suggested we enjoy the dessert buffet on the deck (which was gone when we got there). To add insult to injury, our server added a 20% gratuity to our check.  No where on the menu did it mention gratuity was  to be automatically added.  We surmised that she added it on because she assumed we would not tip due to the horrible service. Overall, this was the absolute worst fine dining experience we have ever had in Philadelphia.  We will NEVER return to this joke of a restaurant.

Our server was congenial but was unable to serve appropriately because of the back ups in the kitchen, at the bar, and apparently at the coffee pot. I had researched the website, called and spoke to them personally, and had been promised an evening to remember. We had been promised Deckside dancing in heated tents. There were no tents per se, it was freezing, and the music was practically nonexistent. It will not surprise you to read that there was no energy up there on the dance floor. All you had to do was walk upstairs, see what was in store for you, and you walked right back down. The bathrooms were crowded, messy, and also freezing.  It is sad to say the only thing superlative about my night at the Moshulu was how much they charged me.

First off I would like to say that I understand that the restaurant is busy on holidays and the level of service and food quality is probably going to suffer. BUT this experience has angered me to the point of vowing NEVER to eat at the Moshulu ever again. SO my new years eve starts off by getting to the restaurant at 6:50pm. I had a reservation for 7:00pm. My date and I were seated after about a 10 minute wait. Not bad, we were seated at 7:00pm. It was a great start to the evening. We ordered 2 glasses of wine and patiently waited for our waiter/waitress to come and take our order. I have exact time stamps because it took our waiter/waitress that long to get to our table. 7:13pm - Waiter comes to the table and takes order for the 4 course meal.             She had: Tuna Tartare (Appetizer), Mushroom Soup (Soup/Salad), Ribs (Main) and the cheesecake (Dessert)             I had: Pork Belly (Appetizer), Lobster Bisque (Soup/Salad), Duck (Main) and the Creme Brulee (Dessert) ....... - While we waited for our appetizer to come out we noticed that some of the staff were confused as to which tables got which dishes. 7:48pm - Waiter comes over and tells me that the appetizer would be right out. 7:52pm - Waitress comes over with 2 Mushroom Soups places them down and just as she is about to pour the soup into the bowl I tell her that we didn't get our appetizers yet. I tell her that I would like to speak with a manager. Manager comes over and I tell him that I am extremely disatisfied with the service here and that I am leaving. Manager continues to say that because it is busy the level of service had suffered and that he would do everything he can to rectify the situation. (At this point both her and I are beyond starving.) The manager convinced us to stay stating that he would also take something off our bill and try his best to salvage our RUINED NYE dinner. Keep in mind that we were hungry when we got to the restaurant and at this point we were to a point where we just weren't hungry anymore. 8:10pm - Appetizer FINALLY makes it out. She ate her Tuna Tartare and I had a bite of my pork belly which I found extremely salty. I offered some to my date and she found it extremely salty as well. [Tuna Tartare was finished/Pork Belly was half finished] 8:24pm - Waiter takes our appetizers away and the manager brings us our soup. At first they brought out 2 Mushroom Soups. NOT RIGHT, I ordered the Lobster Bisque, should have stuck with the Mushroom Soup... The Mushroom Soup was very nice. The Lobster Bisque was not as impressive. The Lobster Bisque was very flavorful but yet again, a bit too much salt for my taste. [Mushroom Soup was finished/Lobster Bisque was barely touched] 8:47pm - The Main Course comes out she had ordered ribs and get some kinds of EXTREMELY DRY braised beef dish and I get the Duck, which was cooked to perfection and tasted great, but at this point we were both so disappointed and frustrated that almost nothing had gone right with dinner, we had completely lost our appetite. We didn't even want our dessert and just wanted our bill because we were now running late for our other plans. Manager comes over and says, ""We just can't get anything right for you 2 tonight"" and continued to say that he would get the desserts packed to go. We reluctantly took the dessert and paid the $140 bill. I wasn't going to leave a tip BUT my date said that it wasn't the right not to leave a tip and left a $60 tip because the original bill came out to $250 + wine. I believe $200 is a lot to pay for the quality of food and the quantity of food eaten. We ended up eating at a McDonalds later on that night because we got hungry and we didn't want to continue drinking on a nearly empty stomach. Moshulu forced me to eat McDonalds as my last meal of 2014... Thank you Moshulu....

Now we really had a chance to see it busy since it was a UFC night. Almost impossible to get a seat at the bar or a table. Maybe that should have been a sign to leave. This place was borderline chaotic. No bouncer, host or any security at all for that matter on a fight night? Asking for problems. By the time we got to a table, we've already had two rounds of drink by squeezing in and out to the bar. I had to grab someone working there to clear our table and let him know we're ordering food.  When the bartender comes over to us, she tells us that we have to go to the bar to place our food orders and drinks even though we're seated at a table that's in the middle of the room.  Also, she needs to keep my credit card behind the bar for the tab. Umm ok. So don't expect typical service like you would at most places that have tables. We can deal with that but not too happy about the food coming out one plate at a time about 15 minutes apart. Everything was very average and the burger was like something I cooked on the grill at home. Medium rare should come out juicy and there was no concern since I was served a hockey puck. But this was the really irritating part.  We're chowing down and the owner came over and said she is going around and collecting the cover for the UFC fight. What?! Collect at the door like any other place would. We ordered four rounds of drinks already and in the middle of receiving food...stupid idea to walk around with a hand stamper just because the main event is coming on. Invest in a doorman if you're so concerned about collecting your cover. She said cover comes with a free drink for each person...fine... she agreed to take a drink off for each of us when the tab was due. I go to the men's room and wannabe MMA college-aged kids acting bathroom tough guy in the mirror. Overheard: #1: ""I'm in the mood to headbutt someone.""   #2: ""me too. I've got the hardest head bro. I should headbutt this wall"" #1: ""yo it wouldn't take much this wood is like an inch thick"" #2: ""hahahah nah I don't want the cops to get called. I still gotta pick up a care package later."" #1: ""you're on your own. I don't do that ish. Don't know how you do.""   Then they left....can't make this stuff up. Exactly the reason why bars need bouncers on PPV fight nights. Tab comes at the end of the night so I remind the owner about her free drink promise..., $2 per person was removed. Last I checked, the drinks weren't $2 each. Didn't feel like arguing...better debated by not coming back.

I went for a taste of Onion Bhajia (and was glad I did). Rice with the mixed vegetable curry (it was good). And Tandoori Chicken (not bad, though the pieces I chose ended up being a bit dry). I finished my meal with some salad and the mint sauce. The highlight of my meal was what I actually went for first - the lentil soup. And on a chilly day like today, both the flavor and the warmth were so welcomed and appreciated. As for the service, the thing I appreciated most? I never felt like I had to go thirsty. They were very attentive and excellent at not breaking the flow of our table conversation. The downfall of my review is that I didn't do a full sampling of the buffet. As you can see, only one curry.

I would have to say my favorites are The O.G. and the Baogulgi; no wonder they're on the permanent menu! They are pretty generous with the bao filling so it can be a little difficult to eat but I'm definitely not complaining about their portions. There aren't that many bubble tea places in Astoria but this place definitely is the best for it. Try the mango stars if you're getting a tea since they're yummy (extra points because they're cute). The service is a little slow so make sure you have patience when you're here but the people behind the counter are really friendly.

Growing up eating gua bao from the streets of Taipei, this definitely does not measure up. It is good for a quick snack with friends.

We enjoyed the yummy bread and herbed dipping sauce at the beginning, but we both found it odd that the waitress served us one small piece each out of a communal basket. We split the filet mignon (which was perfectly cooked and came with green beans, potatoes, and an amazing sauce that left me trying my best to clean the plate) and Statler chicken (good enough but I probably wouldn't order it again, served with Brussels sprouts and au gratin potatoes). The portions were perfect--large enough that we felt full, but not so big that we had leftovers. We split a creme brûlée for dessert, which was huge (maybe the size of my husband's palm) and so yummy. It wasn't accompanied by any fresh fruit, which I thought might be a nice touch since it looked sort of plain on the plate. The service felt a little hit or miss. We waited quite awhile to even be greeted when we arrived even though we were on time for our reservation. The table service was a little on the slow side and not particularly personal. The price for all of that food plus a tip turned out to be around $60, which I found very reasonable. I would recommend Elixir to others looking for a nice night out!

It was rainy/snowy and cold, and we wanted to sit for a while to warm up and the banh mi place (located by Yelp) just wasn't going to do it for us after all. It ended up being the best last-minute switch ever. This place is great!! The place was hopping and nearly full at 2pm on a Saturday, but we were still seated quickly, and tea was dropped off immediately. After that, service dropped off a bit (the only non-5 star part of the day), but everything else was so good, it didn't matter. I will start by saying that I'm no expert in Malaysian cuisine, but I would become one if all Malaysian places are as good as this one. We started with the traditional Roti. I would eat like 4 orders of this as a meal and be happy. The pancake was crispy but not oily. The curry was spicy but not too much. Hubs actually drank the remaining curry after the pancake was gone. Yum. We also had the Poh Piah appetizer. It was not the traditional spring roll that I was expecting, as it was more of a knife and fork type thing than an actual roll you could pick up, but the flavors were awesome. Next up was the Ginger Duck Noodle Soup..... I nearly died. It was awesome. The broth was super flavorful, and the noodles were plentiful. The duck was nicely cooked and tasted great, but the pieces had bones in them still, which made it tricky to eat. I had to basically fish the pieces out and check for/remove bones before eating each piece. It was distracting but not a deal breaker. We also had the Chow Kueh Teow. It was like pad thai, but not sweet. The calamari was a little tough, but the shrimp was good. Overall, an excellent dish. All this food, and the bill came to $26.67. Incredible, because we were totally stuffed and it was so good! (Hubs is a fatty and still went across the street for carry out banh mi to take home afterwards, haha.)

401136,20028,4617,3.0,1,2015-01-03,"No doubt Nynoya is a popular restaurant in heart of Chinatown given there is usually a wait during dinner rush hours and it attracts a diverse crowd ranging from locals to tourists, Chinese and Americans, and old and young alike. Nynoya, a Chinese-owned Malaysian restaurant, has an extensive menu that is not limited to only Malay dishes. They ambitious attempt to tackle dishes ranging from Malay, Singapore,Thai, Cantonese cuisines - and the result is nothing really impress. Needless to say, Nynoya's popularity eludes me. Spicy Thai chicken is not spicy at all. The chicken is fresh and neatly chopped and presented. This one was an anti-climatic experience, because the intended flavor of this dish is unclear. Nyonya's Hainan* Chicken uses the same chicken as for aforementioned Spicy Thai Chicken except the sauce is different - chili dipping sauce is the gem - made from red chili, garlic, dark soy sauce, ginger. Don't be misled - chili sauce is often not spicy. Having had tried this signature Hainan style chicken at a dozen different places, the flavor and quality of Nynoya's was standard at best. *Hainan is name of a province and an island off the southern coast of mainland China. Many of its residents migrated to Southern Asia including Singapore and Malaysia. Hainan chicken is the dish those Chinese migrants brought overseas and made popular. Malay Buddhist is a mixed of pan fried vegetables recommended for vegetarians. Pineapple fried rice, sizzling beef platter, fish head soup - I'd say taste average but filling - gets the work done for a group lunch or dinner. I'll leave you with two things about Nyonya: Nothing is really spicy. Expect mediocrity and you will not be disappointed.

402333,25145,3387,2.0,1,2015-01-08,"Came here last night with my sister and it was empty. We were excited because we love crepes and I found this place on Groupon so I was hoping it'd be our new go to place. Don't really think I'll be coming back though... First off, I bought this Groupon on December 21 and it says, ""Five $7 vouchers: each voucher valid for $7 toward menu items"" and the fine print says, ""Limit 1 per person. Limit 1 voucher per visit. Valid only for option purchased. 7% NJ sales tax not Included. Not valid with other offers or specials. Must use promotional value in 1 visit. "".  Mind you, they have a new Groupon that says the $7 is only towards gelato, shakes, and juices but that's not the one I had purchased. We went in and a gentleman helped us. He was really nice and gave us time to pick out what we wanted since this was our first time here. The menu is a little overwhelming just because everything sounded so good and we wanted everything. He explained to my sister that they used fresh fruit etc. I told him I had a Groupon and he asked to see it. He told me the Groupon couldn't be used for the crepes, only for gelato, shakes, and juice and also said he asked someone to change the Groupon listing because it was making customers believe it could be used for anything on the menu. Well no kidding, since it flat out says that it can be used for menu items, I would think I could use it for crepes since that's their main thing no? ... Anyway, I was kind of taken aback because the Groupon doesn't specify any of that, as you can see. Also, a note, make sure you specify whether or not you want take out or sit in because dine in prices are more expensive. I told the gentleman take out and he said okay. Then another lady came in to help us finish our orders while he made our crepes. It's made on the spot which was nice. We ordered two drinks with the lady, a strawberry banana juice and my sister had the cookies and cream gelato shake. Mind you, we had already told the guy take out, but I guess that wasn't transferred to her. With the Groupon for the shakes, the total still came out to over $21.... I looked at the receipt and she charged us for a large shake when we asked for the small, so we told her and she said, dine in only comes in large. We said we asked for take out and we got a look.... so she looked at the menu and gave us our $2.50 for the shake. We sat down waiting for the food and she brought me my drink...which was in the dine in glass... I thought we said take out? But I didn't even feel like saying anything so I just drank some. This was $1 more for dine in but I didn't even bother asking for the money back just because it was whatever at that point. My sister's shake was so liquidy and my juice really didn't have much flavor to it. Our crepes came out and the boxes were huge. They were like a foot for each crepe, they looked delicious. We took it home and tried it, I was slightly disappointed. I had the exotic, which was blueberries, rasberries, kiwis, and a sauce. The fruit was sour but they're not in season so it's okay, I didn't mind and finished the whole t hing. Overall, the place was nice, clean, and has potential. Personally, I probably won't be coming back but I know many other people will enjoy it here.

In any case, I have had Lamb Vindaloo at other places and they've usually been about half this level.  The one here was literally the spiciest dish I have ever consumed in my life.   I also had their Chicken Tikka which was good, but also a bit spicy (also was dipped in the yogurt toward the end).  I've never had an issue with spiciness at Asian or other Indian restaurants so I am assuming the Indian food here is a tad bit more authentic given my inability to tolerate it.  Really, if you have doubts about your ability to handle spiciness, order a creamy spicy dish instead of the fiery enough to make all your senses shut down Lamb Vindaloo.

Its potato base had completely absorbed the spice mix it had been cooked in. Strong foundation.  The Baingan (Eggplant) was served in thick slices with the spices and drizzled sauce on top.  It was soft and tasty.  The fresh, hot Garlic Naan was excellent, but I had to let it cool for a few moments before I could start tearing it apart manually.  It picked up and held the Chaat well, and provided a nice textural mix with the other dish.   The only real downside to the meal was the restaurant was too cool on a winter night, and thus somewhat uncomfortable.  My hot Masala Tea helped hold off the chill.

Now I know a few of the girls that work the phones, I almost thought it was a joke. When I called back they put me on with whoever was in charge and she yelled at me for 20 mins before I asked for my money back and her response was, ""Dont eat the egg roll "" and she sent someone back to pick up the food!!!! Besides that, I have found plastic and other debris in my food, and I know a few others that have the sane complaint.  The quality of the food is horrible.

Our orders were taken via an iPad which I thought was quite neat and the food came quickly. The staff helped us cook all of the meats so we didn't do any cooking on our own. You can choose from many different proteins- beef, pork, chicken, seafood, duck, lamb, as well as vegetables which I'm sure no one chooses.  My favorite meat was the curried chicken. And while the meats were good, I felt they were overly fatty and oily. Ugh, meat overload. Hello to my love handles. The meats did pair well with sauce which there's an area with an array of sauces/seasoning for you to choose from.

The space, the decor, the service, is actually really good. As my friend noted, you can actually take your non-Asian friends here and not be embarrassed. The menu isn't the biggest I've seen (Flushing still has the edge on that) but it's got a great variety. Our group ordered a large pot for the table (half spicy half curry) and our own individual pots (I got pig bone broth). We ordered a ton of food, including mushrooms, noodles, bok choy (which was not actually bok choy), shrimp, fish balls, tofu, and more. And plates upon plates of meat. I lost count of how many times we asked for beef and lamb. Everything was delicious and fresh. I personally would eat hot pot anytime. I can't get enough of it.

We were sat immediately....But as our meal went on, there was definitely a wait! Hot pot/bbq can't be rushed!! We opted for the hot pot only...i thought the staff would be aware how difficult it would be to share one big hot pot for 8 people, so we needed to request 3 singles to accommodate our party---this caused a delay in eating which wasn't a huge problem. I just wanna warn those that go in the future. We kept our order simple, meats (pork, lamb, beef, chicken), shrimp, crab, some meat balls, and vegetables.

As for the unlimited bbq, great marinade recipes, but in my opinion, they were inferior pieces of beef/pork that were so craftily marinades, that it actually tasted great. Second, service. The hot pot service was excellent, food always came out fast, ordering was easy. The bbq was always lagging in service though. The guy would come around every ten minutes, so I went ahead and cooked the food myself, which I have no problem doing so, but the guy made it seem like out was his job to do so. But waiting ten minutes for him to come around to flip my meat was unreasonable. Plus, they have the bbq burner on lowest setting, almost as if they wanted to slow down the consumption of bbq to save money. I cranked that burner up when he stepped away. Third, the wait. Lord, the wait. On a good day, you'll wait 40 minutes, on a bad day, you'll wait 2.5 hours. Overall, the food is average, you'll have to dish out extra bucks to eat anything special from the hot pot, the bbq is good too. But that wait though, I would return if the wait wasn't extreme, but the food isn't anything spectacular to be waiting an hour for. I wouldn't return, but that doesn't mean the food wasn't good. 3 stars for me.

I have never been more disgusted by a so called dining establishment in my entire life. I went with my fiancé, our 3 year old, 88 year old hard of hearing nanny and my fiancé ' s sister for dinner. First of all the man that sat us and I assume was the owner was rude enough to tell us our son didn't need a highchair after we requested one prior to being sat. Last I checked we could deem a high chair appropriate or not for OUR CHILD whom we have to sit through a meal in public with. After having the chair set at the head of the booth we then proceeded to hear someone FLIPPING OUT at the server station to our left. This said person fortunately turned out to be our server (if that's what you'd call her) luckily when she did not ever through out our meal introduce herself we overhead her name was Celeste that ""served"" us. She had been flipping out in typical Jersey fashion, head bobbing, arms flailing all within our hearing shot about how could she serve us... also pointing directly at our table as there were no others sat near us. It appeared this jewel of a server had a problem with the OWNER having placed our son at the end of a booth. She then finished her scene and came to our table, THREW napkins at the center of the table for us and left later coming back to take drink orders. Our sister excused herself to the restroom and Celeste came to bring our drinks while our sister was gone, having the nerve to tell us at the table that she had great timing bringing them because there was a person missing from the table to serve the glasses. This is the point my fiancé stuck me inside the booth so he could sit at the end near our son and be the SOLE person to handle the waitress as my sister and I now had steam blowing from our ears in aggravation. We should have left by this point but as I said, our sweet very hard of hearing nanny was very excited for the light bite menu and hearing none of this, oblivious to any of our disgust. The food only amplified the disgust. Chicken marsala, no sauce to the meal. My son's macaroni and cheese looked frozen. Sister's chicken parmigiano looked like tomato soup. The best thing this apparent establishment could do is do the general public a favor and shut it's doors, I'd rather take my chances with the service of a McDonald's.

I'm a voracious consumer of Chick-Fil-A style chicken biscuit sandwiches. Unfortunately, New York is a dead zone for good chicken biscuits. These little golden morsels have become things of fantasy. A crunchy, delicious urban myth found only in the deep embrace of the south - until now. Cheeky's fills the once gaping pollo biscuit void with a potent one, two combo. First, the sandwich jabs you in the mouth with a buttery, flaky biscuit. An excellent start. Then the straight right cold cocks you with a crispy, tender chicken breast. Seasoned with a certain fury of potent spices, it will leave your panties in a twist. Then the coleslaw caresses your cheek and whispers sweet apologies for the tongue lashing.

405596,131915,3404,4.0,1,2015-01-05,"TL;DR Get the chicken, don't get the beef.  Definitely try the egg, cheese, smoked salmon on a biscuit.  Brother really likes the half/half po boy.  Beignets are not the best but it's only $1. This hole in the wall, easily missed even if you've been there before spot, is like a godsend for me.  I ate here the first time and was just thinking it was ok (3 star yelp worthy) and a nice little spot.  I woke up the next morning scratching my neck, shaking, and thinking about the chicken sandwich like I needed to attend an AA meeting.  I eventually found out a mosquito bit my neck and it was sorta cold, but I was thinking about that chicken sandwich and went there again for breakfast.  The food is affordable and good.  I expected a spot like this to capitalize on the whole Lower East Side food explosion and charge a little bit more, but it was cheaper than I thought (maybe it's because i order the two cheapest sandwiches in the place).  This has become a regular spot for me when I decide not to eat dumplings.  I regularly get the chicken sandwich and teh egg cheese smoked salmon with an order of beignets. Chicken Sandwich (6.50) must get: Fried chicken on some bombass biscuit and good gravy.  They have the cole slaw mixed in for fiber purposes I'm sure.  I hate cole slaw, but they did something to it where it just fits with the sandwich perfectly.  The chicken was thick and fried gorgeously.  Not that Shake and Bake shit, but some home made batter stuff.  Definitely the must get here. Beef Sandwich (8.00) nah: I'm not a big fan of shredded beef, and I dislike sliced bread when I order in restaurants.  Maybe it's because I think my mom can make a better sandwich than this with beef.  But if your mom is a crap cook then I guess you should try this sliced bread shredded beef thing for $8.00. 2-eggs scrambled with muenster, smoked salmon on biscuit(5.60)get: I can eat this baby for breakfast, lunch, dinner, brunch, linner, brinner man.  I'm not sure why they don't say it's actually a biscuit sandwich (maybe its cause it's not and I always say ""on a biscuit"").  This could use a bit more smoked salmon, but hey it's pretty cheap and smoked salmon is expensive, so i understand. Ben-yays ($1 for 3)get: They are not the best.  I think its because they don't put enough of the powder sugar, but hey it's only a dollar.  It's on beignet away from being dollar dumplings.  You might as well tack this on to your order.   Service:  They are awesome.  They sometimes give me free beignets for no freakin reason.  Maybe it's because i look like a bum or they actually see me as a regular, or maybe they are just generally generous.  Also since the set up is like a bar type situation they are really friendly and actually strike up a conversation with you.  This could be because I'm usually there when it's not crowded and they just don't like awkward silence while I'm waiting for my food.   Ok for the ladies who've read up to this point i got a treat for you.  So I told my friend about this place and he actually said he's been there and the owner is a former black model.  Now let me tell you, I've seen a chiseled jaw, j crew, A&F black model looking type in the kitchen cooking my chicken sandwich who is also very friendly (one of the people who striked up a conversation with me and also gave me free beignets).  I'm a straight man and even I had to say this guy was good looking as hell.  My friend said he used to work for Ford modeling company and i just googled his ass and bam!! MODEL SON! models.com/models/din-ya… you ladies ever wonder what a model cooking looks like?  yea...you have, go to cheeky.  If I was a girl, I would probably have given this place 5 stars after meeting this guy.

We tried two of the fresh hot donuts as well as two specialty donuts. Both hot flavors we sampled (vanilla spice and cinnamon brown sugar) tasted the same, and they were too dense and greasy. Disappointment. The fancy donuts were so heavy I couldn't have more than one bite of a chocolate cake, and it didn't taste as fresh as I was expecting it to taste. I'm not Homer Simpson, but I crave a donut once in a while. Call this blasphemous, but I'd more likely go to Dunkin to grab a donut- a third of the price, tastes fine to me. Saving grace?

405950,199745,2261,3.0,1,2015-01-09,"I'm glad folks from Philly and the surrounding area are calling this place out for being overpriced and over-hyped so that I don't have to look too much like a regional hater, but Federal Donuts continued the trend of our last visit of places that failed to meet our expectations. Luckily none of the food was bad (the service however was terrible), but really nothing stood out as good enough to justify the markup their charging for the experience. We had tried to go to the Pennsport location first, but they closed just as we arrived (3PM closing time seems odd, no?), so we wound up here, and maybe that location is better or something. Due to their proximity, we wind up with a lot of Philly natives down in DC, and as a result there's this constant bickering about cities, so when 2 different fried chicken and donut places opened up in DC a few years ago there were of course cries of ""idea theft"" from Federal Donut lovers. Well, I can say with a good bit of certainty, that not being from either town (although I do now reside in DC), both operations in DC (Astro and GBD) are a far superior product than what we had from this Federal Donuts. The creative donuts are more creative, and made better, and the chicken is fried better. Whether or not they ""stole"" the idea of combining 2 of the country's most beloved items is absurd, I'm sure many of us did that in our dorm rooms, but ultimately all that matters is the end product, and Federal Donuts falls short in that regard for me. As for the donuts, we tried the blackberry walnut, marshmallow squared, and chocolate glazed, along with one of their ""fresh"" made basic donuts, since Suzy isn't really into the fancy flavors. The cake consistency of each of the fancy donuts was well done, but they all just tasted kind of plain. I believe they just use the same cake batter for almost everything and then simply dip it in whatever the flavor is, rather than baking the flavor into the mix. This results in somewhat of a Dunkin Donuts feel to the product, at a much higher premium. The guy doing the fresh donuts was having a good bit of trouble actually making a circle, so Suzy had to keep going back repeatedly to check for her donut (we were literally the only non-employees in the building at the time). Coupled with the fact that he seemed to have a good bit of difficulty answering any questions she had about the menu items, this left us even less impressed with the staff than the actual food. The fried chicken was somewhat better than the donuts in terms of execution. We chose one dry option and one glazed, and I'm fairly certain I wound up consuming the lion's share of it all (no surprise to anyone who knows my background). The za'atar seasoning was nice and heavy on the chicken, adding lots of flavor, but the chicken itself was a bit too dry. The chili garlic was somewhat excessive, I would prefer to not need an entire roll of paper towels to make through an order of 6 wings. It was hard to get a feel for the chicken itself when you're having to scrape off giant chunks of sauce. It just felt sloppily composed, or just lazily executed. It was nice they include a basic donut with each order, to give you something to balance the flavors, but would have been even nicer if it mentioned that on the menu so that we could have adjusted our donut order accordingly. I don't recall exactly what our total for a few donuts and a dozen wings (and maybe a soda and a water) was, but it was somewhere between $30-40, which is fairly ridiculous considering the simple approach to everything. If they were huge yeast donuts (like at Doughnut Plant, VooDoo, or GBD) then maybe I could understand, but these donuts lack that level of effort. To top it off their register has one of those annoying ""tip screens"" that you have to go through before signing for your credit card purchase. You basically have the same job as someone at KFC, and expect a tip for it, on top of your already overpriced product. Get out of here with that nonsense.

Some food recommendations: Chilled cucumber in chili oil, Dan Dan noodles, the pork belly appetizer, string beans with minced pork (can substitute for asparagus told to us by our server) and the eggplant side dish. They do have great entree selections too, but I am so in love with many of their smaller plates that I load up on those.  For 2 people I would recommend 1 entree dish with 2 small plates, or about 4 small plates/sides/appetizers.  All the times I have been there I have taken at least 1 item of food home so the price is worth it! Only thing to watch out for:  gift certificates can sometimes be location based and/or expire.  I was recently given a gift certificate by a family member for Christmas however, that person lives in New York City so the certificate can only be used there.  In the end I don't really mind because I wanted to eat here anyway regardless of the gift certificate, and it just gives me an excuse to head up to New York City.

This Han serves up the familiar, spicy, and delicious Szechuan food that we have all come to know and love. My particular favorites at the Old City location are the dry pepper chicken and the spicy cucumbers. Somehow the cucumbers (7) are spicier than the other Han Dynasties, but the dry pepper chicken (8) is more easily inhaled. Two good things that this Han has going for it are: a) the decor. It is absolutely regal inside and totally fit for any fancy occasion. Big pillars, low lighting, and an impressively large bar reminds me of Del Frisco's. and b) the lunch specials! I suppose the others have this too, but in Old City, there are tons of offices (and me!) hungry for Han, just not hungry enough for an entire dry pot. The dry pepper chicken lunch special is $7.95 and comes with the typical rice. Add the cucumbers (also ~$7) and you have a very happy Gia M not spending her entire paycheck on Chinese food for lunch.

It is definitely authenticated Szechwan (famous in China for great food, probably the best, and pandas) food, I can vouch that as a Szechwan people. Dan Dan noodles is already recommended by a lot others. I would recommend Cold noodles with chill oil and spicy hot pot. Both are spicy enough for Americans and satisfiable for native Szechwan people. For not spicy food, Wontons in Chicken broth is pretty good (my grandparents love it). After all, I do believe that all food should be very good as I spoked to the chef and he is from Szechwan (very rare in other so-called Szechwan restaurant). If you ever had a chance to stay nearby, it is definitely the place you want to try!

Food was pretty good but boy was it greasy! I mean swimming in oil is more like it. In very spicy chili oil more like it. I love spicy food but not everyone in my party did. It was pretty hard to order something not spicy. Everything on the menu had 3+ (level of jalapeño pepper spicy). We had a bunch of different dishes. One that stood out as being awful was the dumplings. We asked for steamed ones and they were indeed steamed and served swimming in hot chili oil. It was pretty shocking having to fish them out. One that stood out as being exceptionally good was the pork belly and garlic beef. We had both ducks offered and very disappointed. One had a very intestinal smell / flavor. Crispy cucumbers were also great. There were no descriptions on the menu and we ordered this dish out of curiosity. Place is gorgeous! Used to be a great lounge/club spots nice and open.

We each had a nice cocktail -- I had a Spanish Manhattan, which was made nice and strong with hardly any sweetness, just the way I like it. She had a Rye Apple, which was also well made, equally strong, but slightly more fruity. The taste of the apple definitely came through. The bartender was really friendly and conversational.

The food is out of this world delicious and cheap, with huge portion sizes! It's a tiny space with an open kitchen: there are probably ~10 tables and there's space to sit at the bar and watch the chefs cook. I was fortunate to have a $40 groupon, but their prices are so reasonable that my boyfriend and I had to purposefully over-order to get past the $40 mark. We took enough food home for at least 2 more meals. Besides some non-alcoholic traditional Mexican beverages, they also have sangria and a few beers. We ordered: Horchata ($3) - Delicious, definitely get it if you're a fan! Guacamole ($7) - Pretty good! They add pomegranate which gives it a little something extra special. My boyfriend loved it and practically ate the entire bowl himself. Esquites ($4) - Corn off the cobb! I was super excited to try this since I can't eat corn on the cob right now and I was just a tad disappointed- it's really watery, almost more like a corn soup. The flavor was different and interesting for sure though. I liked the spices and the taste, but my boyfriend was not a fan. Chicken Tinga Quesadilla ($5!!) - This is a total steal for the price and probably my favorite bite of the meal. GET IT! Torta de Milanesa de Pollo (8!) - This is a hefty sandwich for the price! The flavors were spot-on.. I loved the breaded chicken, avocado and jalapenos on a nice soft, squishy bun. Yum, I'd definitely get this again. Chile Relleno de Tinga ($13) - We also really enjoyed this dish- it was moist, flavorful chicken on top of a poblano pepper with a tasty mole sauce. I'd get this again for sure too. Carlota ($5) - YOU HAVE TO GET THIS. It's an incredible citrus cream pie. Forget key lime pie- this is way better! A little sour and a little sweet, it's perfection. TL;DR: You need to go here!!

We walked in and were say immediately at a table near the door. Fond installs an extra entryway during the cold months and it was quite effective at keeping the cold out but the windows are not sealed well at all so there was a constant breeze, luckily we were already dressed in sweaters and there was a small heater at our table. On to the food..... We ordered a few cocktails to begin the meal and they were good and strong. We started off with a few appetizers, the scallops and the steak tar-tare which was a special. The scallops were awesome and the accompanying cranberry sauce was very nice. The steak tar-tare was good but it was a little salty I believe from the amount of capers that were used. If this was the chef's intention then he achieved it, the bread that accompanied the tar-tare worked to balance the saltiness out a bit. For entrees we went with the skate with squash risotto and the arctic char with gnocchi and mushroom gray sauce. The one knock against the entrees was the squash risotto that came with the skate, there was a super intense pumpkin spice and/or nutmeg flavor and again if that was chef's intention he achieved it, it was just a little over-powering to me personally. Overall everything was wonderful and we thoroughly enjoyed everything. We ended the meal with a few desserts, the vanilla bean creme brulee and malted milk chocolate ice cream. Both were outstanding.

If you get here early enough they do have happy hour which is an amazing deal.  Certainly a great way to get to try many of their dishes at a more reasonable price compared to their regular dinner menu.   For happy hour we were able to try the una con todo, taco de suadero, the chips and guac, sopesitos, and the costilla en chicilo.  The waitress was attentive, the kitchen was fast, and the food was very, very good.  The una con todo is as the name would imply a little bit of everything.  It would be great to go along with a beer because it's a little box of deep fried goodies, I particularly enjoyed the deep fried cheese which was a lot like deep fried cheese curds.  The taco de suadero was awesome, the meat was perfectly seasoned, very well cooked, and I could not find any faults with it.  The chips and guac was awesome, mostly because they made their own chips and they were nice and thick and crunchy.  The sopesito was probably the weakest dish we had out of the bunch because the flavors just weren't there and the corn boat had more of a styrofoam like consistency which was a bit off putting.  Finally with my gut busting, we ordered a full entree.  The costilla en chicilo was alright, could have been more flavorful but it was perfectly cooked and the sunchoke puree was really good.  The short ribs were as you would want, fork tender. All in all, I would say definitely a restaurant I want to be coming back to because the food was so good.

Last year we ordered shrimp in a couple of dishes and the shrimp was majorly overcooked and my husband got sick from something in the red curry. I still went back figuring it was a one time thing. Nope. The second time the shrimp was over cooked again. Overall, not the best Thai in the area.

Good food on most occasions, although it fluctuates from time to time. sometimes, when I order Medium spicy, they bring it really spicy and other times its not that spicy (same dish comparison) the worst is the service, their service seriously pisses me off upto an extent where I want to throw stuff at their face. One such incident: I kept calling them multiple times to order, they wouldn't answer the phone. I started driving there while continuously calling them, I called them atleast 12 times. no answer. I got there I parked the car and they finally answered, I said, I would like to place an order for a pick up. she said, sure one minute. i waited for about 7 minutes, hung up the phone and walked in to place the order in person. the place was busy and they are always understaffed so I can understand a bit of delay.. but still, there's no excuse for the service. I walked over and stood near the counter. She was just standing there writing something on some paper.. waited for another 5-10 minutes.. in the meantime, she gets a phone call and she answers the phone call and begins to take the order even though i was standing there waiting to give the order. At this point, I was about to walk out, but didn't want to be rude. after she was done with the phone call, I asked her, can you take my order, i have been waiting for a long time even before your phone call. she was like, ""sure, sure"" and then finally took my order. this isn't the first time when something like this happened here. even when I go there with my colleagues, we have a difficult time getting good service.. I swear I am not going there again to deal with such service!! I wish I can talk to the owner about this...

BIG PROBLEM IS.... they keep the bar open during the show and that means people get up and need to cross in front of you an unbelievable amount of times because they need alcohol to enjoy the show (insert eye roll here.) Plus, the bartenders when we went on Dec. 28th didn't follow CT's law about one drink per person at a time. Drunk and obnoxious party of 10+ behind us kept coming back with 2-3 drinks each every time. Finally asked to move seats (it had to be much further back, unfortunately.) No one (including security) seemed inclined to get these people under control. Really rough, especially when this was a surprise for my husband for Christmas. It would have been a 5 star experience if the inside-the-venue-bar had been closed once the show began.

If you aren't looking for this type of experience you should not come here. With that being said, Big Wong has been a family favorite of ours whenever we're in town visiting. This place has been here since my dad was a child and still has some of the same staff working here since then! At prime dining hours the wait can be long, but usually only 20-30 minutes, but if you come early in the day around 11AM or between 2 and 4PM there is no wait. Our favorites to order here are: San Bao Fan (3 treasure rice) - char siu (BBQ pork), soy sauce chicken, and duck over a bed of rice with a fried egg Shrimp Wonton Noodle Soup Congee Fried Beef Chow Fun Char Siu Pan Fried Noodles with Gravy Dried Shrimp Rice Crepes Lobster (when they have it as it is seasonal) Everything we've had here is authentic Cantonese and absolutely delicious and oh so cheap!

Vinted is lined with wine stations, offering you a really cool tasting experience. Here, you can order anything from a 1 oz taste to a full glass. We found our server/bartender, I believe his name is Greg, to be super knowledgeable and just really pleasant to talk to. He could talk extensively about craft cocktails, wine and beer to the point that my accompanying booze nerd friends, found themselves listening, for once. Food was fantastic. We ordered crispy pork ribs, with a hint of 5-spice and the perfect skin. Buttered crab legs,  pulled pork tacos rounded it out. Tacos are generally easy, simple, and good. These tacos were delicious. The menu is wide-ranging, the plates are well executed and beautiful. It is on the pricier side, but you are getting a delicious dish. The bartender ended up sending us home with some very hard-to-find craft brews to try. It was a dining experience to remember.

I explain that I don't want the 30 minute old meal that was opened and returned by a stranger, and she confirms that this is in fact a fresh meal, not that original one. So she hands me the wrinkled bag and charges full price. I get home and of course open up a cold, 30-minute old meal that was clearly just returned by a stranger.

One of the major perks for me is that they participate with grubhub so I was able to have it delivered. I had the vegetable samosas which were cooked perfectly. The outside was a nice golden brown and the potatoes inside were chock full of flavor. I also had the chicken tikka masala. In my opinion this is one of the best that I've ever tried. Granted I haven't been to every single Indian restaurant in the world but I have been to quite a few and Karma's is at the top. The tomato and cream sauce was perfectly balanced, the chicken was very tender and I asked for it medium spice and it was just that. Usually most places even when you tell them medium they try to burn your insides up. This was perfect. Just spicy enough to amp up the flavor but not overpowering where all you taste is heat. But the item that sealed the deal for me was the galub jamun. This is by far one of my favorite deserts but I can't always get it. Again nothing but perfection for me.

I ended up settling for a lavender milk tea with boba, green tea and white chocolate waffle, vegetable steamed bun, and rice noodle with egg. I really liked my boba because it was chewy and I could taste the artificial lavender flavoring that I like. The waffle was especially good when it was still fresh and crispy, although I couldn't taste any green tea there whatsoever. I didn't quite like the steamed bun and rice noodle.

Oh and now they do delivery through foodler.com which makes it even more convenient :)

Both places are nicely designed, cozy and well lit - Staff: Our french waiter at Cotenna was a bit eccentric; I find the waitress at DM to be a bit 'hurried'. Advantage: Cotenna. - Food: The burratta is significantly better at DM; the meatballs are better too. I prefer the orecchiete with sausage at Cotenna. Advantage: DM - Wine: I didn't have any at Cotenna, so.. N/A, for now - Tie-breaker: Tough to choose one, so let's go with price... Cotenna slightly beats out DM since all of its pasta plates are a mere $12, and their specialties were all under $20. Final recommendation: If food taste is the utmost priority, then I'd say go to Da Marcella and enjoy. If you're looking for a more complete meal out, then go and enjoy Cotenna.   4 stars.

It's not a big place, just an L shaped counter to order at and a half dozen or so stools along a shallow wall shelf to eat at. The ordering process is a bit of an assembly line, like a subway or chipotle, which likely speaks to ambitions of expansion and franchising. I went on a cold weekend and got the slammin salmon. It was pretty good, though eating it in my car (their few seats were full) proved a small challenge. Their lemonade wasn't worth it, I'll have to try the other beverages at some point.

We had croquetas de pollo and de jamón, split a Cubano and a pastelito de guayaba y queso. Everything was pretty good.

425156,10270,3653,3.0,1,2015-01-04,"As the January 2015 RW comes upon us, one place to consider is Iron Chef Jose Garces' Rosa Blanca. I stopped by for one of the first RW's after its inception, looking forward to the Cuban comfort food offered by the venerable chef. Despite the entire restaurant being open, I was relegated to the bar while I waited for the GF. Fine if it's busy, but when the entire restaurant is open? Meh. The design is Miami 80's retro, with the wait staff dressed in white shirts and bow ties. Jukeboxes are on display at the booths, with Cuban music playing overhead. The inside section of the restaurant is less of a Cuban diner and slightly more formal and elegant. It's still speaks to a relaxed, cool vibe though. Restaurant Week [$35 pp] The RW menu at Rosa Blanca was a list of their a la carte menu items. So I've provided the a la carte pricing as well, though as expected, RW dinner is $35 pp for 3 courses each. Guacamole Cubano [$8] Smoked pineapple, chips The GF decided to try the guac, which was a sweet iteration, with smoked pineapple. The plaintain chips were nicely fried, though the guac was such a tiny portion. Enough for three decent scoops. Pulpo en Escabeche [$12] Grilled marinated octopus The pulpo was a better dish, highlighting tender octopus with great char. The escabeche marinade and sauce was on point, showcasing great acidity. Ropa Vieja [$19] Shredded brisket stew, rice, black beans For the main, I went with the sweet and tender ropa vieja. A decent portion of starchy rice, delicious black beans, and shredded brisket was on offer here. Churrasco [$22] Grilled marinated skirt steak, fries The GF's steak was tender and came out nicely medium-rare. It could have used more seasoning though. The matchstick fries were nice to round out this steak frites a la Cuba. Yuca Frita [$3] The yuca fries were great - crisp on the outside and creamy within. The accompanying aioli was a nice mix of ketchup, garlic, mayo, and lime. Queso Frito [$4] Do get the fried cheese - intensely buttery and highlighting duality in textures. This was crisp on the outside and tender within. Tembleque de Coco Coconut custard, yogurt streusel, mango sorbet This custard-based dessert had nice texture as well. The creaminess of the coconut custard was balanced by sour crumbles of yogurt brown butter streusel and tart mango sorbet. Pastel de Pina Pineapple upside down cake, panela mousse, guava Reminiscent of flan, this was sweet, with the essence of pineapple and guava throughout. Incredibly creamy and smooth. Overall, RW at Rosa Blanca was decent, but I may have set my expectations too high. When compared to the Iron Chef's efforts at Tinto or JG Domestic, it was a bit lack-luster. Still, the strength of the octopus dish alone has me intrigued enough to come back. Pro tip: Always get the pulpo at any of Chef Garces' restos.

This restaurant is definitely a step up from a typical Chinese buffet, though I'm not sure it can compare to some of the sushi buffets that are out there. The selection includes a stir-fry bar (where you can choose your ingredients and they'll cook it for you), sushi, American food, dim sum, soup, Chinese-American food, and more authentic Chinese dishes. This place is very good for the price, since lunch is under $10 with plenty of variety and weekend/dinner is just over $15 with additional items such as roast duck, crab, and lobster.

After trying out the chicken burger and sweet potato tots, I'd have to say I'm a fan. The burger was very juicy, tangy (from what I think was a tamarind ""Walla"" sauce), and just all around delicious. The burger wasn't as overtly ""Indian"" as I was expecting, but still a great blend of flavors. The assortment of condiments (spicy ketchup, spicy mayo, etc.) were a great adjunct to an already tasty meal. Also of note: loved the quirky details on the napkin holders and sauce bottles! It seemed to be a busy day, as our food took 15+ minutes to come off of the grill, but we didn't mind as the extremely courteous gentleman at the counter (not sure if he was the owner or manager) was very apologetic and even made rounds to each table to make sure all of the orders met customer expectations. With that kind of service, the wait seemed worth it. If I could round my rating up to 4.5, I would. Great new addition to Halsey St! Looking forward to my next visit.

Of course, I was running late so I called in and they said they have a 10 minute grace period, Phew! The service was efficient and the food was amazing. The Mac and Cheese was SOOO GOOOD. I would say it's probably the best Mac and Cheese I've ever had. Just the right amount of crust, cheese, salt, ugh, everything about it was just amazing. This ""side"" does come in a decent portion that'd be good for 2-3 people. I would dare to just order two mac and cheese and call it my entree. It was my first time having this fried chicken and waffle combo and I'm so glad that I chose to have it at Soco. The fried chicken and red velvet waffles were amazing too! I think I'd prefer mine with no syrup and extra powder sugar instead. Regardless, it was still pretty perfect. The skirt steak was cooked medium rare to my liking and it came over a bed of sautéed spinach and sweet potato hash then topped with two sunny side up eggs and cress. The dish was topped with a smoky sauce that gave the eggs a unique barbecue-tasting flavor. The hash had too much onions for my liking but my guests enjoyed it. The fish and chips were a disappointment. The fish had the strongest earthy, muddy, dirt taste to it and it did not pair well with the kimchee aioli sauce that it came with. I'll never order this dish again. The fries were just okay. I opted not to have the unlimited mimosa hour because I had a minor in the party and didn't want to cause any complications but I'll definitely be back to get my drink on.

It took a while for entrepreneurs to figure it out. For years suburban steakshops had the formula down, selling takeout beer along with pizzas, hoagies, and cheesesteaks, but not to many city places did the same. Now we've got multiple bottle shops, and Corner Foodery is one of the leaders of the pack, with a huge beer selection and seating that like it's there for more than qualifying for takeout beer sales. Had some good fries too, while sitting at the table by the front window. Hopefully more outside the box thinking, like bottle shops and pop up beer gardens, will show the dinosaurs in Harrisburg we need modern booze laws.

Then, we see that she completely left out one very important item that my husband HEARD me order. Which resulted in him having to go back out to complete his dinner. They didn't give us enough chopsticks, soy sauce, etc. A word of advice to this new establishment, if you want to last long... step up your game.

Food: It seems like there is something for everyone. The menu is very large, but this is good because it offers many options for beginner or advanced Thai cuisine options. If i'm in the mood for some comforting noodles, I always go for the pad si eow with beef, I love it! A few of my other favorites are the Loc Lac dish and Phuket Seafood. The Loc Lac is my husbands favorite dish because it is a meat dish, and the steak is cooked perfectly every time; just about medium well. Both my husband and I always start our dinners with soup. I tend to go with the tofu noodle soup (super simple but delicious), but my husband tends to go for tom yum soup with seafood because he enjoys spicy dishes. OH, and best of all, we often go on Monday or Tuesday nights because they offer half price on bottles of wine! Such a great special. Service: The service is always wonderful. The restaurant has a mostly young staff that are always so friendly. All of the employees all seem to work well together, and always seem to be having a good time while at work. The servers are also especially helpful in understanding the thai cuisine menu. Since the menu is extensive, and a little bit foreign to me sometimes, it's always nice to have a knowledgable staff to ask questions. The servers also do a great job at modifying the dishes, since they are made to order. They gave us the option of modifying the spice on any dish, and also adding or removing certain vegetables or proteins. I always appreciate when restaurants are so accommodating, because often times they aren't. Decor: This place is a nice hidden gem in West Hartford center. The interior door is just beautiful and follows a color theme. It looks especially nice in the evening when the lights are dimmed. And if you're lucky, you will get the window tables, which always seems to be most popular. Overall, dining here is never a disappointment. Our food is always delicious and the service is always attentive. We often notice the owner himself coming around to check on the tables and making sure everything is great.

The food here is always good, I wouldn't say they're outstanding by any means, but they're always at least a bit above average.  On my most recent visit, I ordered the carbonara pasta and a spiked milkshake called all nighter (I think).

The prices are pretty moderate and you get a fair portion for what you pay for. What makes this place special is the cool seating arrangments for groups of four or more. If you like flavor and medium heat, go for the spicier menu options. There's usually a long wait for dinner so I'd suggest trying this place for a late lunch on a weekday if you can!

The noodles are hakata styled thin noodles, well done not too doughy and not too chewy. I'd give the ramen a 4 star. -1 star for the quantity. For $15 per bowl i expect more. I think around $9-10 would be more reasonable. I also ordered karaage, it was very so so, i did not like it. the chicken was over fried over cooked, it was so tough really hard to chew. 1.5 star for the presentation -3.5 star for the taste.

434714,212849,3745,4.0,1,2015-01-03,"Me and my boyfriend came here as a recommended place for ramen from our friends. We dropped by around 7 pm and it was already packed, were advised that the wait will be 3 hours. Because it was our last day of visiting New York we decided to wait. They had a text notification system that let's you know when your table is ready soon, this was handy if you didn't want to stick around for the wait. The decor was superb, very modern and edgy yet still incorporates instances of Japanese tradition. The surroundings were low light and combined with the music (down tempo electronic with ambient touch) just gave such a cool vibe. Because it was so loud and busy it made it a bustling hopping place. We each ordered a bowl of ramen and Japanese beverage. He ordered a Japanese ale and I a citrus sake, of which I was disappointed it was served on the rocks with way too much ice and very little drink! The ramen were just what I dreamt of. My favourite part is always a the soup, and my Modern hit the spot. The only thing I would change is a bit more toppings even if it's in exchange for the portion of noodle (I never seem to finish that). Overall the restaurant is recommended, but my biggest disappointment was the service. The hostess wasn't really the hostess with the mostest ( just simply weren't friendly at all, made me feel unwelcomed somehow). I also felt very rushed from the beginning of being seated. We've only just sat down and given menus, were so excited after all the wait and admiring the decor and busyness, and were asked if we were ready to order 3 times when we weren't ready. Also as we were near the end of the bowl, and have paused a bit while enjoying our drinks and chat, we were asked so many times if we were finished, it definitely got annoying. At this time it was around 11 and the queue has subsided. I went to the bathroom and my boyfriend told me that the waiter advised that 'our 1 hour time limit is up' and suggested that if we were to stay we would have to order more food. I understand that this might be norm for busy restaurants like these but I would have really appreciated the host to tell us upfront about this, especially if we have to wait 3 hours for a table. As a last kick in the face.....You know how waiters usually let you take your time to leave after you've sign for your bill? Mine retrieved the bill pretty much right after I've set it down, giving us the last 'shove' out the door. Overall, I would definitely recommend the place, especially great for date night. The ramen is about as good as it gets. However, the service just didn't quite meet my expectations. Unless you're totally comfortable waiting 3 hours for a fast food experience (in terms of speed)......I'd opt for a place that is a bit more accommodating.

We came right at noon, starving and were a bit dismayed by the large crowd waiting. But thank goodness they took our name and were willing to call us when our table was ready. We stopped into Strand (fun bookstore, and I am always looking for an excuse to go) during our wait. A couple in our group was visiting from out of state and it was their first time for ramen and Strand. What i found really great about this situation was that Ippudo called to tell us our table was almost ready - considerate and understanding that we would have ventured during our wait, giving us time to walk back. As we were escorted to our table the staff shouted their welcome as we walked by. It is a bit out of the ordinary, but definitely gets you smiling all the same and i thought it was a fun touch. Made me excited for my meal! And so did the atmosphere; from the seating to the decor, it wasn't just a meal, it was a dining experience! As I stated, a couple of us were ramen newbies and our waitress was so incredibly helpful and happy to make recommendations. i REALLY appreciate this in a staff. We started with the Hirata pork buns, which was recommended to me before coming. Again, the staff was really cool to anticipate our sharing and split the buns into four so that we could all try them. The buns were an intriguing experience - having a different texture. i am not one to favor a mayo base so they were not as good as i expected them to be, but still very good all the same. i'm glad i tried them and that i could share them with others. the real star (quite obviously) was the ramen. i had the karaka-men and was beyond satisfied and thrilled with my choice. It was the perfect amount of spice and heat. The pork was delicious, very flavorful and easy to eat considering it can be tricky to command if you're not used to eating noodles with chopsticks. But like i said it was a dining experience! sensory overload in the best possible way. From the colors of the meal as it is first placed in front of you, to stirring the ingredients together yourself seeing it all merge together, and then balancing the tastes between slurping from a giant beautiful spoon and then swapping in your chopsticks, it was just plain fun! Others in my group that were new, had the akamaru modern and they said it was the perfect introduction to ramen. I was only there a few days ago and i am still dreaming of going back as soon as possible. i'm so happy i finally got to try this place and would recommend this to anyone! ramen newbie or not! and can i just say again how great the staff was the entire meal! They made sure our water glasses were always filled and asked how we enjoyed the recommendations. Just down right great.

I've been here 3 times & every time, it disappoints me even more. First off, the Hirata buns are no joke! I've never had chasiu that delicious. I've also never paid $9 for two pieces of chasiu before. I don't think I can see myself in the paying that much for chasiu any time soon. The real problem was in the ramen, you know, the main thing they sell. I don't mind the waiting, that's a given and I live in NYC. What I do mind however, is waiting an hour on average for the most abundantly watered down ramen I've ever had. For a place that's so hyped, I was kind of offended having paid more than average for tasteless noodles. Maybe tasteless is the wrong word. It was like slightly flavored water... very slight. Also very sad. I'll give them the small benefit that it was right when they opened... but stiiiiiiiiiiiiill.

This lack grew even more vexing with the recent departures of Nodding Head and Triumph, whose beers I didn't particularly enjoy but filled a needed niche nonetheless. Upon hearing of 2nd Story's arrival in the old Triumph space, I grew eager to see whether or not the new ownership had improved upon the brews and bites available previously. Though I did not sample any food, the four beers I did try all hit the spot. Brews sampled included the Adsultim, Riverwards IPA, 117 Pale Ale, and Tilted Barn Saison. Of the four, the saison fared most poorly as it lacked some of the complexity I associate with the style, but was still quaffable. The other three varieties all refreshed immensely and celebrated the nuances of different hop varieties. None were aggressively bitter, as the brewers here seem to favor the more flavorful and aromatic hop varieties like Citra, Cascade, and Chinook. A healthy mix of malts also kept the beers complex and interesting. The beers were rather affordable, too, at $3-5 a pint with cheaper, smaller sizes available for those with less gastric real estate than me. Few things beat an incredibly fresh beer, and I look forward to continuing to sample 2nd Story's selection (and maybe catch a meal - the food looked damn good).

Ipas can be very different depending on which hops they use and 2nd story uses all of the hops that I like.

The smooth texture is perfect to dip the warm pita bread. No extra charge for more pita bread in case you are wondering. The baklava is perfect to wrap up the night with. The sweetness of it will balance out the bitter/dry wine you get (of course we got red wine). The variety of tapas are relatively inexpensive so it's a great place to go with a group of friends. We got 2bottles of wine and 5-6 tapas and the five of us ended up paying about $31 each. So it's really not bad at all! This was my second time dining in at Beyoglu and I know my friends had come here before too. Everyone was willing to go again or try it out, and everyone left very satisfied. If you want a good chill night with good food, service at a lively ambience that's not crazy, and care of your money's worth, give Beyoglu a try.

I've been trying to go here (no joke) for about a year but have always been too hungry to wait, and every time I tried to go, there was a wait. Cut to the Sunday after Christmas and my friend and I tried our luck for 7:00. To my surprise, we got seated right away. An even bigger surprise was that there was an upstairs! The place was still packed, they just happened to have a table for two open. Whew. The menu itself has a lot of small dishes. So you could really go the tapas route or an app and main meal. We kind of did both. We started with the hummus, the yogurt with cucumber and garlic, the spicy beef and the crab cakes. They were all out of this world. The beef tastes a little like kielbasa which I liked and had fantastic flavor. The crab cakes were also a highlight. I'm not a fish person and there wasn't too fishy of a flavor to them which was great. If you think the yogurt is too heavy, don't - it's actually kind of refreshing! After that, we both got salads. I got the Greek and it was probably one of the best I've had. Between the feta and dressing...ugh I'm craving it right now. Bottom line: go here.

We were seated right away.Their extensive cocktails menu can be pretty intimidating if you are used to seeing only a couple standard cocktails in most bars/ restaurants.I ordered the Dark and Stormy and it was amaaazing.I really enjoyed sucking the sugarcane stick drenched in alcohol at the end of the drink. Hubby stuck to an old fashioned Indian beer.We ordered few appetizers to go with the drinks.The crispy okra, tandoori tigers prawns and the chili cheese toast were all a home run.One thing I will remember for next time is to have the chili cheese toast first as it tends to get soggy within minutes.The flavor on the tiger prawns was so intense that I am almost salivating just writing about it. The owners were around when we went in and they seemed to have their eyes on every table even though they were seated and entertaining a group of people.The ambiance is serene and beautiful.Love the little touches to reflect the colonial era in India.If you are from Bombay you will be transported to the town side of Bombay where in many places the colonial era has stood still.

The outside of this restaurant looks abandoned. Seriously, I had a hard time looking for this restaurant after returning from a 6-month trip in Malaysia. The signboard is so weathered it's devoid of color. There is also no significant lighting outside. Good luck trying to find it after sunsets. Fortunately, the interior is on par, if not better than Penang. and the customer service is by far the best of the 3. The staff are friendly and attentive but not overly intrusive. I am always well attended to. I have no objections to the price. Although I will probably prefer a different restaurant if it is located in Malaysia. It is priced similarly to Penang. In conclusion, I think this restaurant has everything to rival Penang restaurant if they would just fix their signboard...

Seriously this place should be on everyone's to do list. A ""Bucket List""  basically to experience probably the greatest fulfilling  meal , with money left over.  Fellow Yelper and friend Jason K. and I decided to get breakfast, and why not grub at the Grubhouse. Now before I dive into this like a fat kid to a cupcake.  I just want to say this as I scream to the food gods in my George Takei voice.... OH MY ! youtu.be/6nSKkwzwdW4 So lets dive into this and lets see  if I can make your mouth water the way ours did. We decided to get 2 dishes,  1 being the Breakfast Burrito , 2nd being Bacon Pancakes, yes I said Bacon Pancakes! The burrito grande is stuffed with chorizo, onions, peppers, eggs, black beans, sour cream, hot sauce and cheddar.  This is a must order, a must I tell you that is simply phenomenal . The other was the grubhouse bacon pancakes. Picture this 3 ginormous fluffy pancakes with bacon cooked inside. Yes your read that correctly, cooked inside chopped up with the syrup mixed with it was AMAZING! Plus they top with 2 strips of bacon for good measure. With this feast in front of us with our coffee that was fresh and not watered down made for an amazing meal. The price for all of this with out the tip mind you , now get ready $18.50. Plate fillers, basically a food coma waiting to happen all for that crazy amount. The service was on point, friendly service actually where Gale (fellow Yelper) was doing her thing . Gale made sure we were fully accommodated, from coffees to great conversations being had. Not only is it a plus to see Gale, she also makes an unbelievable cheesecake, a white chocolate one to be exact. I highly recommend this spot for everyone, from the service down to the amazing food to be devoured.  Grubhouse, you guys are a winner in my book.

Located next to Zenkichi with the seating arranged around a big tree in the middle. I felt like Alice in Wonderland! Amazing! We ordered the organic apple cider shake and a cup of macha latte. Yes. The apple cider shake was expensive ($6) but hay, I would never come here every weekend, so why not give it a try. The shake was very interesting and I don't know how to describe. Kinda taste like yakult but not that sweet. And please remember to eat that piece of pickled apple. It was not so sweet nor sour. I ate it after I finished my meal and it was the right ending to refresh my taste. The macha latta was great too. Very strong macha flavor with thick macha foam on top. Make sure you mix the drink since the macha powder tend to settle down at the bottom of the cup after a while. We had the teriyaki chicken meatballs with miso soup and taco rice. The teryaki chicken meatballs was so aromatic. I love the smell of that sweet, slight burnt, seaweed and rice smell. But it was a small dish with 5 juicy meatballs. Love the soft boil egg. It's perfect to have that runny yolk mixed with seaweed and teryaki sauce and meatballs. But I did feel a little weird about the meatballs, tasted slightly sour, don't know why. The taco rice was a balanced meal with meat, carb and veges. It was a little weird eating hot meat sauce with cold avocado for me. I love and really recommend this place for all. It's a sweet adventure. Be aware, the seating was pretty small.

Okay now that's out of the way, I can rave about the food!  I had a $40 fixed meal.  Calamari was my app, and I was very pleased with the unique preparation.  I hate aioli, and though this had some on the side, it was perfectly fried, drizzled with balsamic and served with delicious sweet, lightly hot red peppers called peppadews.  Marvelous! Dinner was chicken in a hearty marsala sauce with some of the best mashed potatoes I've ever had (and I don't eat them often!).  The veggies were a nice variety as well...from artichokes to mushrooms.

Every time I bring a different friend to this place, they always wanna go back. The atmosphere of the place alone sets it apart from any other hookah/middle eastern restaurant I've been to. It can get dark and cozy inside, to alive, and sometimes packed outside on the patio. The staff is super friendly, including the owner himself, who likes to interact and engage in conversation (something to definitely appreciate). He's also known to create custom hookah flavors and even hosts Hookah Tasting Nights where you can try new upcoming flavors and meet new people. We went to one a few months ago and it was a really fun night. The crowd that comes to Mediterranea can be very diverse and makes it a very social place. I've met some cool people just by sitting one table over. The food is great and authentic. We usually get a bunch of appetizers (the falafel tastes like the ones id get from Lebanon) but sometimes well get an entree (the swordfish kabobs are amazing!). They also have a kids menu that offers boneless wings and fries and lastly, the hookahs. They offer traditional flavors and have a menu for delicious specialty hookah flavors that changes often, which makes you want to come back and try something new! Overall, its the perfect place to hang out with friends, even bring a date, enjoy some great food, hookah, some wine (BYOB). The pricing is pretty reasonable compared to other places, and if you go with a group, even better.

I have hosted parties there for organizations I belong to and the service and attention to detail has always been on point. I have been there as well for personal meals with small groups and the service and food has always been exceptional whether I am ordering sit-down entrees or just a couple slices of pizza. Consistently their food is served quickly and always hot, regardless of how many parties are in the place. The wide array of choices on the menu do not, in any way, bring down the quality and taste of the food. Because everything is made fresh, you wind up with an aroma-filled, piping hot meal that is not just delicious but satisfying. So far I am about 2/3 of the way through the options on the menu and I have yet to have a ""bad"" experience. The pizza. When I agree with Sam P. and his comment that it is comparable to NYC pizza, I refer to the joints in NYC. The crust is just crusty enough, the cheese melted just enough, the toppings heated to just the right temperature. And without the overwhelming amounts of grease (I can't degrade oils by using their name) that many places think are needed. Within the South Brunswick area, their delivery times are very, very good. They are well aware of the time frame it takes to make the food properly and the traffic based on the location you are calling from. The time frame given is always aware of these realities and always on point. It doesn't matter if I am thinking a quick slice for lunch or a full-on dinner event, Capriccio's will be the go to place on this side of Route 1.

I've always walked by this place in all seasons and called ahead to see if they could accommodate 2 and I was in luck. We walked in and were seated right away. I knew the food was good and the atmosphere cool but I did not know they had such a great brunch deal. There is a pre-fixe option for bottomless brunch or half liter of your choice of drink. They also have multiple options depending on how many people are in the group. For example for 2-3 people you can order 1 pizza+ 2 small plates+1 side. That is what we did. It was just enough for two people and we each had a half liter of a brunch cocktail. We had the margherita pizza, the french toast, the cacio e pepe and of course, applewood smoked bacon. Where to start? I thought the french toast was a little too soggy for my liking. The taste was great, don't get me wrong but it was soaked in brown butter. I know I know, how can anything soaked in brown butter be bad? It was just too much. I did love the  twist with rosemary focaccia and the berry compote. The cacio e pepe was super simple but was delicious....soft scrambled eggs, cacio cheese and cracked black pepper. I am really being picky here but the bacon was very undercooked. I like my bacon crispy but I'll eat bacon pretty much anyway it's brought to me but this was too much. Now, onto the pizza. The pizza was really good. A nice crust, not too soggy in the middle. The size of the pizza is meant to be split and have as a shared dish with some other smaller plates.  Overall I liked this place and am curious to get back and try other menus. Until next time...

I feel that Lombardi's has great sauce, John's has great crust, but Grimaldi's has the best mixture of all. I've been here a couple of time and only once I have to wait in line for about an hour, but, since I was waiting for a friend, it was OK. The restaurant is pretty decent looking. One of the few bad things to say about this place is that they know that they are top of the line, so they don't really appreciate their clientele as they should. Basically, you have to feel thankful that they let you in. But, as they are SO great, they can get away with it. The prices are good. $16 for a large pizza is more that great. Regarding the ingredients, the cheese is great but what took me away was the pepperoni. really thick and kind of crunchy. It's right next to the Fulton Ferry landing, so it makes a great stroll after eating to get great views of the Manhattan skyline.

This restaurant is beautiful though. High ceilings, windows, 2-floor seating and a bar- it doesn't get as cool as it does to dine here. However, the wait was too long, along with the time it took us to receive our pizza. The pizza was just OK. What kind of disappointed me the most was the fact that it was barely warm. Yeah yeah, your restaurant is by the water so it's automatically much more chilly in the area but not the pizza alright? Leave the pizza out of this... Overall, a place to go if you're willing to wait and experience what's supposed to be 'the best', just don't expect much from the food itself.

Without further ado, let's straight to my bday dinner, shall we :) First course, kohlrabi salad with hazelnut milk, pear. I don't recall I have had fresh kohlrabi before - it is not a common veggie in Hong Kong where I am from; it is mostly found in Yunan province and usually fermented. So this is brand new to me. The thinly sliced cylindrical veggie has very mild taste and crunchy texture. It serves as a perfect vehicle to absorb the hazelnut milk dressing. It is a good starter, light and clean taste, just enough to open up your appetite. Second course, seared monkish in horseradish foam dusted over dried seaweed. I love monkfish. It is perfectly cooked, great texture and paired well with the seasoning. I would recommend pairing with champagne or other dry white wine as the horseradish foam has a whipped cheese like salty taste but without the heavy-cheesiness. Third course, strip loin with purple cabbage,  swiss chard in an anchovy dressing. It's a chunk of sexy beef, perfectly charred outside and medium rare, juicy inside. Dessert! First act, coffee parfait con passion fruit cream. It is not bad; I just had difficulty to pair them together. If I could, I would just have two scoops of the coffee parfait. This is so creamy so coffee-y. Second dessert, popcorn mousse with mandarin ice and popcorn sugar. This is to die for ! I usually can't finish any dessert but this is an exception - more savory than sweet, great contrary of texture and salty-sweet taste. Perfect to finish up with a dripped coffee made with Colombian coffee beans from a local Brooklyn roaster. Overall, very good food, even better services. Jen, the bar tender, makes killer cocktails. And she has a great personality. The vibe was eccentric and vibrant. .  When I got there around 7, it was about 70% full, by 9pm, it was at full swing. But it never got too loud, which I appreciate. If you like me eating out frequently, you should know that for this quality of food and creative tasting menu, with wine pairing, it easily goes beyond $120/pp in NYC. Yet it is only $55 to start at Contra (drinks are $15ish for wine/cocktails)!  I shall def come back more often :) Happy New Year!

I ordered the Brisket Sliders and they were awesome. Fries were good as well and the siracha mayo dip that went with them was great. Both agreed the food was great and would come again when visiting. If they are offering their Hot Cider with Maker's Mark it is a must to order! Especially on a cold night like tonight!

I don't like spinach so the softness of the poached egg and the sweetness of the lobster meat definitely helped balance it out. The potato hash they served on the side was super delicious although heavily seasoned. Definitely no need for ketchup, a nice way to break up the creamy notes of the hollandaise sauce and poached egg. $22 for the whole dish, but portions are definitely hefty.

Or Pomegranate Teriyaki. Do not order a regular size fries alone. If you do not have friends you will make friends if you share your Pommes Frites. A regular size fry is sharing size.

This place is not fancy at all.  They literally only have two booths which seat about 4 adults maybe 5.  If, you time it correctly you might be lucky enough to sit in one of them.  I love that their tables have pre-cut circles in them to hold your French fry cones.  They also have counter seating but it's also pretty tricky because there are about 5 or 6 seats.  If you come with a pretty large group, you might as well have them bag your fries and take it out with you.  Every time I have gone here it has been pretty busy. They offer so many sauce options and they are really good about giving you free samples to taste, but I only get their piping hot cheese sauce.  I have had their wasabi sauce, plus some other ones but it was a bit too heavy for me because the base to most of their sauces is mayo. This is one of my favorite places to go for comfort food.  I normally like to take relatives and friends who are visiting NYC here as part of the tour of the city and it has always been a hit.  I find that this place is a great hidden treasure that can't be missed

Pat's has history going for it. If you're going for a tour de cheesesteak, may as well visit the place where it all started. 2. Cheese fries were great. Nice and crunchy with a tasty cheese sauce, even if it did come out of an unappealing vat. The bad: 1. Cheesesteaks were meh. Much better options out there, in my opinion (Cosmi's and Sonny's were demonstrably better, probably because they were cooked to order). Clearly prefabbed items being churned out here. Meat was way too tough, over-browned, and lacked flavor. Cheese came out of a pretty dirty vat. 2. Parking is an absolutely nightmare-- be forewarned. 3. Service is, well, you'll see below. The unexpected(ly bad): 1. My girlfriend and I wanted to split a sandwich so we'd have room for other places. When she requested it be cut in half, the server responded, "" What's the matter, can't handle eight inches?"" to which all the male servers laughed.

Hands down winner is Pat's If you have come or thinking about going it's the right place. You will find none better. As per the steak. Significantly noticeable difference between Geno's and Pats's. The steak at Pat's is simply more flavorful. The minced meat takes in more flavor from the grilling, the onions, and the whiz. The roll used at Pat's is nigh softer and more moist than Geno's which leads to a more scrumptious bite. The onions used at Pats I believe are a different onion. It seemed to me to be a sweeter onion at Pat's. Finally the fries from Pats are similar to Burger King fries. A little bit better in my opinion. Nevertheless the only cheesesteak for me will be Pat's. Happy fooding.

We went when it was cold and windy, so it added to the experience. They had a nice menu, quite large. The sandwiches are a bit small and are overpriced. I could get a Subway steak sandwich which will probably be of similar quality, which is cheaper and bigger. The steak itself was so bland and fatty.

We also enjoyed the fact that it was cut up unlike the steak at Geno's. In the end the staff here was polite unlike Geno's. The sandwiches tasted way better and the overall experience here was comfortable unlike the interaction at Geno's. The final true reason why this restaurant was better was because it wasn't filled with anti immigration propaganda like Geno's.

I love ramen, on the West coast I live near Sawtelle and we have our fair share of ramen joints. So I expected a lot out of this place because it's Manhattan, it's expensive, and the extensive reviews. When you charge $15 for a bowl of ramen, it better be pretty damn big or pretty damn good. The sad truth of my experience is that it's none of the above. We ordered some kind of a specialty appetizer on a sizzling plate with ramen noodles and sausage. It was tiny. It tastes like some kind of onion sauce and with meat, nothing special, and it costed about $13-15. Next came our ramen. Tried the modern ramen and there was a spicy one I forgot the name. Both on the salty side and reallly nothing special. I can think of so many other better ramen spots in LA that charge a lot less. Chashu, forgettable... The environment was nice and the service was great, but it won't make up for the food or the serious upcharge. So for my little trip, I decided to abandon eating ramen in NY altogether if this is such a highly regarded ramen restaurant.

The only reason for not offering a 5 star review is simply because the vegetarian options leave a lot to be desired.  My girlfriend is vegetarian, and she was under-whelmed by the Sho-Jin.  I certainly understand the difficulty of making a vegetarian option when the flavor by nature usually comes from bones - but given the proclivity of Manhattan-ites looking for Vegetarian Options - you'd think they'd make sure they are covering that customer base.

I have eaten many items on the menu here and everything - I mean EVERYTHING - is fantastic.  Thank god I don't live close by, or else I would be getting really, really fat on their food. Some of my favorite appetizers include the Shishito Peppers, the Pork Hirata Buns, and the Ebi & Kani Croquettes.  The yuzu salt that they provide with the Shishito Peppers is off the chain.  I never let them take it away once we've finished our peppers because I like to use it on other items.  I order Shishito Peppers whenever I see them on a menu, but these continue to reign supreme.  The Ebi & Kani Croquettes are good in the way that croquettes are always good.  I like the Asian translation of what I typically feel is a Spanish food - it's just so warm and cheesy and delicious.  How could you go wrong with that?  The Pork Hirata Buns are truly the pièce de résistance.  I crave these.  As I am writing this, my mouth is literally watering.  The pillowy buns filled with crisp lettuce, juicy umami pork (never overly fatty or gritty), and the incredible combination of spicy sauce and mayo....I die.  I may have to go get some today... For ramen, my friends and I alternate between the Shiromaru Hakata Classic, the Akamaru Modern, and the Karaka-men.  You really can't go wrong with any of these three, as the latter two more or less build upon the awesome flavor of the first.  If you're not incredibly adventurous, the Shiromaru Hakata Classic is probably your best bet.  Don't get me wrong - it has tons of flavor - but it's the most traditional offering here (hence the name).  My personal favorite is the Akamaru Modern, as it is a bolder interpretation of the Classic, and I like my ramen to have bold, complex flavors.  The Karaka-men is great, but you have to enjoy spicy food to order this (although it isn't blindingly spicy).  The good thing is that, if you order this dish, you probably don't need to order the Bakudan add-on.  Also, props for making a spicy ramen that isn't one note.  I feel like that's such a consistent issue at the other ramen joints I've tried. For dessert, they always have an interesting line-up of sorbet and gelato courtesy of il laboratorio del gelato.  I feel like that is the perfect way to end a dinner filled with such temperature-hot, umami foods. Overall - this place is just amazing.  You can't live in New York and not try it out.  I just pray that they start taking reservations.  With Ivan Ramen and Mu Ramen both offering reservations now, I feel like they have to follow suit.

The ramen can be simplified for kids (no ginger, no green stuff) so adults can enjoy a good meal. The food was delicious as expected. The kids enjoyed the drama of waiters shouting in Japanese as food was delivered to the table. But I write this review to share a couple of not-so-obvious facts: - there is a strict no-add on policy (which I completely understand) but we were meeting friends who just wanted to hang out at the table away from a cold, windy NYC night. They found us eventually. - they do not allow take-out because ""we cannot guarantee the quality of the food when you leave the restaurant"". We over ordered and had a few pieces of chicken left. When I proceeded to wrap the rest in a plastic bag to take home, the waitress returned twice to inform me about the diminishing quality of my meal. This is unnecessarily pretentious and ruins an otherwise excellent experience.

For those of you put off by the thought of eating noodles that have been swimming in a cup of your morning brew, let me assuage your fears:  this is one delicious bowl of ramen. The promise of a bourbon-based dashi broth is what sold me, as I don't think I've ever seen a ""Red-Eye Bourbon Shoyu"" anywhere before.  The first thing that hits you is the fragrant, sweet and almost candied aroma as the bowl is down.  The next thing that caught my attention was how subtle and well balanced the broth was:  both the coffee and bourbon were subtle undertones that did not clamour for attention to themselves, but created unique layers of flavour that were familiar and comforting.   The house smoked maple cured duck breast was also tender and succulent, although I nearly wept as I consumed the only two pieces that came with the bowl.  The spicy corn kernels and crunchy-fried onions were also perfect textural complements to this dish, although I am inherently biased as a uber-lover of almost anything corn. The coffee dashi broth can sound a bit off putting/borderline repugnant, but the folks at Ippudo have pulled it off and created something delicious and well worth trying, ESPECIALLY if this is your umpteenth time here and you are ready for something new.  Hope this one sticks around for a while!

Hakata Classic Ramen, plus egg PROS -amazing broth, very flavorful and super savory, pork based -good quantity: I'm a pretty light eater though so don't quote me on this. -request for extra ramen noodles applicable: for those of you who want extra carbs to go with that awesome soup. -egg was perfect. perfect.  Not too salty either.

I think I just died retyping out that description. PROS -perfect combination of flavors and textures. -you're supposed to dump the milk into the parfait: Admittedly, I was the dumb noob who was sipping it out of the shot glass.

I'm no connoisseur of ramen (other experts can tell you about the subtle nuances in different gradations of broth quality and noodle texture at varying locations), but I think that they serve a consistently solid bowl of hot and tasty ramen, especially during the winter months. The presentation is great, with large wooden spoons and an artistic bowl. I also think that Ramen Bar is a great go-to for its nice ambiance - clean, simple, and modern. The layout helps to accommodate groups as well; I typically visit with 6-10 friends and it's easy to arrange the smaller tables together to fit your group size. Pretty much all the ramen on the menu range from 10-14 dollars, which is slightly on the pricier end for noodles. It's a good size bowl, but several of the guys I go with often end up buying extra noodles for $2 to add to their bowl afterwards (if you plan to do so, make you sure you save enough broth as you're eating!). Finally, if you'd like a recommendation (since there are quite a few ramen options on the menu), I'd say many of them are relatively similar but my personal favorite would probably be the spicy miso, which comes with my preferred wavy noodles instead of straight ones!

It's nice that they will give you a taste of a couple beers if you want. Now, I don't really need that help much because I usually know my beers, but I like a place to have a knowledgeable waitstaff. The food here is pretty average. I've had a couple of the appetizers but nothing has been memorable except the mac and cheese, which is quite delicious.

The Chile Rellenos - arguably the best on the planet.. and enough for two as our waiter pointed out. The enchiladas - our traditional favorites, as splendid as we remembered it to be. The only downside - adding it just so it is an objective review - we were seated in a corner to the side off the bar where there was too much traffic, and with a strong draft of the cold outside air... and we noticed that there were better seating options...

472266,13588,3902,3.0,1,2015-01-02,"So I took a group of friends here for NYE dinner and can't honestly say that I enjoyed the experience. I picked it because my old firm threw a small party here a few years ago and I remember the food being quite delicious and the venue being spacious. Well the space hasn't changed, but the food sure as hell has. The 11 of us ordered an assortment of dishes, ranging from the the lamb to cavatelli, and steak and char. Everything looked pretty average, but let me just touch on the dishes that I sampled/consumed. My lamb was absolutely disgusting. In all 25 years of my life, this was hands down the worst lamb I have ever had. I didn't even know you could do lamb this wrong. It was dry, tasteless, tough, and slightly cold. I honestly was at a loss of words when the waiter came by to check on my food and how we were doing. Everyone else had managed to consume most if not all of their food except me. ME. I'm the dude who usually wraps up first and then some. I can honestly count on my two hands how many times I've left leftovers on my dish at a restaurant. In this instance, about 2/3 of the lamb was still left. The waiter was definitely concerned so he brought it back and after the chef did confirm that it was awful, decided to wipe it off our bill. This was great. You did good, waiter-with-the-dapper-haircut. You did good. That said, everything else was pretty awful too. The cavatelli was clumpy. Clumpy. And it tasted just as awful as it looked. The mac n cheese, which I had specifically ordered as a side precisely because it tasted so good 3 years ago, also fell flat. The best part of this meal was the group that I was with and the fact that we were able to order two nice bottles of champagne at the end. Other than that, wow was this place a fail when it comes to food.

The squash appetizer had a rancid truffle oil flavor, and the pastas were lackluster. The gnocchi was tough on the outside and rubbery on the inside. The sauce consisted of bits of congealed cheese unevenly coating the gnocchi and the overcooked crunchy mushrooms. The special duck pasta was soggy and the duck ""ragu"" was so ground up that one couldn't tell it was duck. For the main course, the poularde pieces ranged from rubbery to dry, and a $165 40 oz Cote de Boeuf that we shared was gristly and didn't have enough beef flavor for an aged steak. The maple glaze was too sweet and detracted from the taste. The fried potato balls were crispy on the outside, but rubbery on the inside. Also, it was incredibly small for a supposedly 40oz steak.

It happens...) Lots of ducks and peacocks. No decoration required. Beautiful just the way it is. Health Notes: Probably friendly to paleo and ketogenic dieters. I had a salmon dish with veggies. The staff and chefs at Rat's are happy to modify dishes for allergens or vegetarians.

Our three least favorite aspects of the night were the winter sazerac and the overwhelmingly rich, fatty menu with little relief offered, and the tooth-achingly sweet desserts. The sazerac was nothing like a true sazerac. Rather than rinse the glass with absinthe and dump it out, there was just absinthe sitting at the bottom of the glass, which affected the flavor. The balance in general was off compared to the many sazeracs we've had in New Orleans. The menu was over the top indulgent - the first course was the only one that really offered light-ish options (two salads among the four choices, but then I went for the foie because I can't help myself). In the middle of the meat course, I headed downstairs to the bathroom. When I came back up the staircase into the dining room, the smell changed considerably to something laced with rich foods and the air itself felt heavy with fat -- it was almost a little nauseating after a meal of heavy indulgence, not that there's a lot you can do about it. I went downstairs again later, partially just to catch some fresher air. The two dessert choices were also just too much to top everything off, and not particularly balanced. I would've preferred a light option - sorbet and cookies or something - to the caramel and chocolate choices we were presented. Toward the middle, it definitely felt a little busier than they could handle. Water glasses went unfilled, signals were getting crossed about when to bring new flatware, and service just felt a little off -- it may have been that we were in a small room with a lot of cross traffic, though -- others may not have noticed it. That said, there were highlights -- the portion sizes were generous for a tasting menu. The gnocchi were great, as always. The foie was another favorite - I thought the accompanying marmalade brioche, etc. were really well done.  The wine was also paired well. So in all, I had a good experience, but I was hoping for a little more than good.

I know that Shabu Shabu uses lighter broth compare to Chinese Hot Pot, but usually they came in chicken broth or some type of herb broth, Shabu Shabu in plain water is a first for me. The sauce is decent, but boil meat in plain water doesn't really entice my taste buds. And the waitress was going to use the spoon to clean up the oil, hmmm, that's the best part! Maybe I'm missing something, but I had my share of hot pot and Shabu Shabu, this is the first time I ever seen a plain water Shabu Shabu, and I don't like it, so I'm gonna pass.

And the Prime Rib Eye and Rib Eye Shabu Shabu were authentic and we enjoyed their veggies and noodles too. We also had their sausage and tofu, which were around average.

480872,13798,2404,3.0,1,2015-01-04,"When Traif opened, with its high price-point and deliberately provocative name, it came with a narrative. Was South Williamsburg ready for this type of place? Was it respective to waive a gentrification, porcine-eating flag so blatantly in the direction of the Hasidism on the other side of Broadway? With a few years distance, answers emerged - the inventive food, like the cinnamon-sugar ribs, justified the price point, and many other restaurants, boutiques and condo developments ensure this was place was no outlier. And a string of morally-abhorrent incidents in the Orthodox community, including discriminatory buses, divorce-seeking goon squads and sexual abuse cases, makes it much easier to not feel guilty about a very gentle joke inside a restaurant name. Xixa is a victory lap from the same team - more small plates, more silly Jewish-inspired names. But with concerns about the place asked and answered, Xixa came with much less hype than its predecessor. I'd loved the few meals at had at Traif, but let months and months pass by before heading to the restaurant. And seven months have passed from the meal to filing this review. How can quite well done, ambitious food be greeted with such a shrug? I think Xixa's cardinal mistake is mashing up two genres that will strike many at first blush as being as appealing as that pregnancy craving standby the pickle ice-cream. The main wrap on New York Mexican food is that chefs simultaneously flatten the cuisine with concessions to the American palate while making it too fussy. And there's no better way to make food simultaneously more American and fussy by turning it into ""small plates."" Xixa even had the bad fortune to arrive about two years ahead of several ambitious Mexican places - Mission Cantina, Empellon al Pastor - so couldn't even be ""on trend."" But whatever - past the think-pieces and concern with trends, a meal here (""we recommend ordering between two and three plates per person""; ""I'd be happy to help you assemble a meal if this is your first time dining with us"") is a solid experience. Our party of five - celebrating the imminent departure of a friend for London - didn't mean liberally spending and sampling from all over the extensive menu. It's been so long since the meal and the menu continues to rotate that it wouldn't be terribly useful to describe most of what we had, which included restaurant staples like the carrot elite and al pastor foie gras and other things long since departed from the menu. Needless to say, lingering over cocktails pushed the meal past three hours, and the place never was so full that anyone had to eat on a Friday night. Perhaps the other diners in this fair city realize that while you can get a decent meal here, the city's story is being written elsewhere.

We were understandably pissed, but since a table at Traif was no longer possible, the maitre 'd gave us a free cocktail and then escorted us over to Xixa. By the end of our meal, we were so happy for the mix up that I wouldn't even fault the reservationist for the mistake. We got the chefs tasting menu -- 12 courses for $45pp. Incredible amount of food and SO GOOD. We all wanted to be rolled out of the restaurant we were so full by the end. We also all got their cocktails -- a very interested concoction that involves a cube of a cocktail with different liqueur of your choosing poured on top.

Their mustard is also on point, as are the onion rings. Your best bet is to just  smother everything in the relish and enjoy. Just don't ask them what's in the relish - my bf made the mistake and was asked if he had at least a million bucks and if he wanted a baseball bat to the head. This place is legendary and everyone should experience it.

I only go inside and usually sit at the bar.  I love the feel of the place.  It's like it never aged from the 1950's.  The bartender is my favorite!  She always leaves halfway through the meal to go have a smoke.  She always asks if we are OK before she heads out.  The beer is served cold, and in old school glasses. I've had the ripper, burger with gravy, beef with gravy, and of course gravy fries.  I always enjoy the food.  The deep fried hot dogs are delicious and I usually have them with mustard and ketchup.  The burger is small (think Stewarts small) so there is definitely way more bun than burger.  Whatever, the gravy on the bun is a good time as well.   Like I said, I don't go often, but when I am feeling a bit naughty I like to eat some food from Rutt's Hut and drink some cheap beer.  Their prices are definitely right!

I am native Chinese and my husband is vegetarian who adores Asian food and we live in NYC.  We travelled to Thailand plenty of times. We drove by the area on a snowy day and found this place through Yelp and thought would give it a try as we were not interested in eating Italian or American food. I had mango curry shrimp, steamed veggie with peanut butter sauce, and my husband had stir fried eggplant w/mock duck plus coconut soup. My son wanted to eat satay chicken (grilled chicken on stick) which was what he usually wanted in Thai place. We didn't see the choice on the menu and were trying to get my son something different and when the owner heard our conversation she offered cooking for him off menu. When red jasimine rice was served, my son refused to eat it as he was used to white rice, but the owner sweetly and magically persuaded him taking one bite and my son finished the whole thing! We were all AWED by the quality of the food but what really made this place standing out from all other Thai places was it was successful in bringing you more with less. In typical Thai place, (NYC or Thailand), you would walk out feeling satisfied but know you can't eat like that everyday bc of the amount of oil and sauce you have consumed is not that healthy.  But this place's dish is full of flavor but also light on oil and heavy taste sauce. Healthy and tasty?! That's pretty hard to do for East Asian food (except for Japanese). At last, the owner and staff were super friendly and attentive. Decoration is also cute and they have a photo of the fifth King of Thailand cooking! How special is that! We have seen royal family photos in plenty of Thai restaurants but have never seen one so full of life. Feel like the owner put a lot of thoughts behind the food and place, making them pleasant and simple. Love love it and highly recommend!!

In the past, I preferred to come here for the pub/patio in the back as opposed to the dining room adjacent to Witherspoon Street. At its core, A&B always seemed to be more of a pub than a restaurant, and I felt it missed the mark on attempts at higher end fare. The beer list here is most improved: at any given time, there are oven a dozen well selected craft beers from the likes of Victory, Ballast Point and Sculpin, among others. I recently dined here post renovation. We started with the calamari, which I liked, but quite honestly, the ginger sauce would have been better on the side: some pieces had way too much sauce while others were dry. For my meal, I got the dry aged burger. Although I ordered it rare, I received it medium well. The Guinness caramelized onions and the Irish cheddar were good; however, overcooking the meat killed it for me. As a beer snob, I'm pleased with the offerings on tap. My only complaint would be not to repeat taps in the newer front bar and instead use those duplicate tap handles for additional offerings. Otherwise, keep up the good work!

My mother asked for the Rigatoni Alla Buttera, but with peppers and onions as they would put on the Sweet Italian Sausage Sandwich, and I ordered the Ravioli Con Salsa with whole wheat ravioli. My mother really enjoyed her rigatoni, though her only complaint was that the sausage was ground instead of big chunks as she would have wanted. There was some confusion with my order - they brought out whole wheat penne instead of ravioli, with the plate's tomato and creamy mushroom sauce trappings. I felt bad asking them to take it back, but apparently there was some miscommunication where the guy who took my order didn't tell me there was no whole wheat ravioli, only penne. The waitress was apologetic and fixed my order, even though it came out after my mother was done eating. It turned out to be delicious! We shared a very good tiramisu for dessert. I would recommend this place if you don't want to break the bank on a meal in Times Square, and if you want really good food in a nice setting.

I would not order the General Tso or Sweet and Sour dish. Maybe it's just me but if you like SUGAR sauce in your dinner plate then these dishes will serve you well. So what are the reasons for giving them 3 stars as opposed to 2 or 1? 1. Fast delivery & Great manner. 2. Cheaper price (and faster delivery) than Dao palate. 3. Stir fry dishes taste pretty good and Thank Goodness no thick and shiny and gluey sauce. 4. Good portion size. 5. Love their fried appetizers - chicken nuggets and Salt & Pepper chicken (It's fried. What's not to love ? ) Will I order from Zen regularly?

So, I had some high expectations here. Also, a few of my friends worked for pizza 46 for years and always raved about it. I ordered a chicken parm sandwich on garlic bread and eggplant rollatini appetizer at 10:21 pm. I know they close at 11 but I live half a mile away and tip REALLY generously. I got my food super quick. That's where the 1 star comes from! But unfortunately, all of my food was just barely lukewarm. Not warm, not hot, lukewarm. The eggplant wasn't half bad. Absolutely slathered in sauce which I'm not a fan of but I know some people like that. The cheese on top was just barely melted. My chicken parm sandwich was the biggest letdown. The ""garlic bread"" doesn't taste like garlic at all. It came with ONE flat piece of chicken on each half of bread. The chicken didn't even fully cover the length of the bread. Good sauce ration, but again, barely melted cheese. The chicken itself tasted like it had been left in a fridge uncovered for some time. Not pleasant. It also came in a styrofoam box which makes ZERO sense to me. No wonder the sandwich wasn't hot. I'm disappointed I spent $9 on this excuse for a sandwich. All in all, I'll never order again. And even if the excuse for this meal was that I called so late, that would just up my desire to never give them my business again.

The set is simple- savory soboro over mixed grain rice with edamae, shiso and egg, some pickled cucumber and pickled lotus root with mushrooms. However, it hit just the spot and still felt really healthy. The tea is made with great care and high quality ingredients- the lunch set comes with really nice genmai tea (with teapot refills!)

And this isn't even counting the day in November when I called because my friend who lives out of the country was in town and the guy I spoke to on the phone tried to be sarcastic and funny when I asked for a table. (It ended up being a 60 minute wait, which I wasn't inclined to wait for). Anyway, due to the weather no doubt, today there was no wait time to be seated. I had a pick of a few tables and I picked one I thought would be most convenient for our party of three. However it was freezing cold where we sat.  Our waitress seemed like a nice girl who was overwhelmed by the number of tables she was serving. But it took her forever to come get our dinner order after entering an appetizer; we asked her to see about the cola we ordered because it tasted like seltzer and we asked about the draft in the restaurant.  None of these were addressed. She never came to check more than once on us and it took an exceptionally long time to get our food. We were there for over 2.5hrs tonight and our entrees got there 2 hours into the meal. I figured our food would be the only saving grace - however, after asking for the 10oz fm cooked medium well, my steak was medium and bloody and my rice was bland, mushy and cold. I took most of it home because my father in law, who was already aggravated by the cold and his diet cola being a seltzer was at the point where he was going to cause a scene. Additionally, the salads were some wilted lettuce and two cherry tomatoes, and even though I requested no onions, my salad came full of them.  Honestly, no one in our party was very happy tonight considering the price of our meal and I don't see myself coming here again for a very, very long while, which is disappointing because my boyfriend and I raved about this place so much we got a lot of our friends and acquaintances to drive from all over to come here.  God only knows what type of service they received.

488627,36287,4083,3.0,1,2015-01-04,"DISCLAIMER: I am very very fussy when it comes to meatballs; my grandmother made the best meatballs known to man and was never received anything less than praise from any person fortunate enough to have enjoyed her cooking.  It takes a truly incredible meat ball for me to even continue eating after trying a bite, because i just have the best memories and high standards to compare it to.  That being said, these meatballs were decent. I've been to the Meatball Shop a few times over the years.  The restaurant has an interesting and unique way of placing your order: mark off your meal with a black erase-able pen, from a laminated sheet that lists all possible options and combinations.  The food and service are good (not super great), while prices are a bit high. You start off your order by deciding what kind of meat you want the ball(s) to be made of.  In traditional Italian meatballs, there are multiple types of meat in the mix, but here you choose from: Chicken, Spicy Pork, Beef or even Veggie.  Step Two is to select the type of sauce for each of the ball(s).  Options consist of Classic or spicy tomato, Pesto, Mushroom or a Creamy Parmesan sauce.  You can make your ball into a slider or hero and do all sorts of things to it to get it the way you like.  In addition to the main attraction, there are a wide range of side dishes to complement your meat - Polenta, Mashed Potatoes, Salad, Pasta or Veggies AND dessert. Although i didn't find the taste of the balls to be exquisite, but rather the combination of available flavors were entertaining and satisfying.  My favorite meatball was the special of the day (or week, idk which); the Buffalo Chicken flavored balls.  I also didn't find any of the pasta to be really be up to par.  There was never enough sauce in our bowls and it seemed quite dry and over cooked. The best part of the meal really are the ice-cream sandwiches.  A massive scoop of ice-cream is squished between two cookies.  With an actually pretty wide range of cookies to choose from  (Snickerdoodle, Ginger, Brownie-Walnut, Chocolate Chip or Oatmeal Raisin), and your basic ice cream flavors, it is well warranted to save some room for dessert.

When we sat down our very efficient waitress Julia the waitress brought us a basket of tri-color chips with both green and red salsa which were all obviously FRESH and I thought yummy! I never know what to order at a Mexican place so I looked around and saw what other people were having that looked good and, voila, I ordered the ground beef chili relleno. It was absolutely delicious and the re-fried beans they served with it were awesome (the perfect comfort food after my crazy day at work).  I also had a delicious margarita (simple, basic, delicious and on the rocks - not one of the crazy and over construed yuppie versions that have recently been forced upon me). The decor had a Southwestern/Mexican vibe. It was not upscale by any means, but was a cozy and homey place to kick back and enjoy some comfort food. I will be going back soon. Thanks for the great meal.

I stopped in and picked up a muffin and a chipwich. Without sharing too much information lets just say I had to pull over about 10 minutes later and full out run into Dunkin Donuts.

I learned about this place a year ago and hands down one of my favorite places to come and eat great food for a reasonable price. I may be boring but their enchiladas are everything and more. Probably order it every time I've been there. I also had the banana cake dessert i believe which was great as well. As per the service, superb! The place gets really crowded but we somehow always find a table and are seated within minutes. Moreover, the hosts and servers are great. Their drink selection is even better. I ordered one margarita and the waiter noticed I barely drank from it (a tad spicy, just not my taste.) So he suggested I order a new drink with no extra cost. Atmosphere wise it is pretty dark but accented with candle lighting. It's dressy causal overall one of my favorite little finds in the city

There was not enough flavoring--it seemed like they just thought putting something in a deep fryer would give it flavor. It is also hard to track down the waiter.

Bloomfield is so lucky to have this gem right in the center of town. In high school, my friends and I used to come here for lunch during early dismissals or to celebrate an occasion. I come here probably twice a month, since I don't live in town anymore, and occasionally order, as well. Over the years, the presentation of the sushi has improved exponentially. Whenever they bring my plate over, my eyes light up - they make my food look so pretty to the point where sometimes I don't even want to touch it... but once my chopsticks are in hand, it's game over. Their lunch bento boxes come with a lot of food for a low price. I always go with either the beef negimaki box or the chicken katsu box. Never ever fails me.They also let you switch out the California roll for another roll for a low additional charge. The chicken katsu is on point every time I get it. I seriously cannot take how big the dinner portion is. I could barely finish half of it. I haven't tried anything here that I didn't enjoy. Their sushi rolls have a great fish to rice ratio unlike other sushi spots that may put much more rice than fish to rip you off. The Godzilla roll is one of my top choices whenever I choose to get a specialty roll. As for he service, it is always amazing. My glass of water is never empty and the waitresses do a good job of checking up on you with your meal. Even their delivery boys are really friendly. They don't just drop your food off and take their tip; they engage in small talk with you, which is what you need sometimes after a long day at work. All in all, you should, without a doubt, take the time out of your day and have a meal here. You won't regret it! Oh and how could I forget? BYOB!

Maybe it was what I ordered, the chilaquiles con pollo.  This is going to sound mean but it was honestly a bore to get through the whole thing.  First couple bites were like OK, this is pretty good.  Then it just got old.  The chips were soggy, every bite was the same consistency, temperature and flavor.  Just was a big lump of mush to me;  no contrast from the cheese, the chicken, nothing.   Can't remember what my girlfriend had which should say something because I've had other Mexican dishes elsewhere that have occupied brain space for many months, just a matter of making an impression.  Nothing but the mush made an impression here. The setup, interior, and service were just fine for me, but a couple months out after having eaten so many other places since I just can't see myself making a point to come back here.  Others seem to love it so good on them, just not my cup of tea I guess.

It's in a bit of a strange place and might be hard to see unless you're really paying attention... luckily I was brunching with Yelp queen Michelle C, who knew right where she was going! The manager here, Qamara, is so friendly and welcomed us with a smile and some menus. I was coming down with a cold and didn't want my usual coffee, so she made me some chamomile tea with lemon which was the perfect remedy. The menu is pretty big and has so many great options, from burritos, to enchiladas, to omelettes, and even breakfast nachos. It's seriously hard to choose. I ended up ordering the breakfast burrito, and it was absolutely delicious and huge. I could sadly only manage to eat half of it, but saved the rest for later. The chips and salsa we had before our food came out was also awesome. This place is so cozy and serves up some great food. Don't hesitate to stop by!

I've had the salmon dish here a few times and it so good that I don't want to try anything else.  I love the roasted poblano with creamy queso that comes with it.  The guacamole is also really solid.  I hear the whole roasted chickens are really great too, so although not really Mexican I'll have to give it a try.

I got the vegetarian enchiladas and added a side of rice and beans (which are not vegetarian due to the use of chicken stock in the spanish rice).  I liked that the enchiladas came with a fried egg.  I thought they were good, but not great.  The rice and beans were tasty and cuminy and come topped with some queso fresca. We got a passionfruit cocktail mixer (whole carafe) for $10 to mix with our champagne.  It came with ice, so I wish our server would have said something before we ordered, seeing the obvious bottle of champagne we brought with us.  I wasn't totally sure how it would blend with the champagne, but it was delicious. Additional tips:  They take reservations for parties of 6 or more and Tuesdays are ""taco tuesdays.""  Instead of the two tacos that normally come with the dish, you get three for the same price.  Bonus:  Check in on Yelp and get 10% off your order on Taco Tuesdays.

Let's start with the positives: + the sets come with noodles, meat, vegetables, and egg, so you really feel like you are eating a balanced and complete meal + the meat was flavorful and well marbled, especially compared to other shabu shabu or hot pot places in the area + you get a nice selection of vegetables, including squash, spinach, and oyster mushrooms + the house broth has no preservatives in it. This is huge for me, as my body - the additive meter - usually experiences an allergic reaction after consuming hot pot + Simply Shabu is slightly cheaper than the hot pot restaurant that just opened nearby And now the negatives: - even though you pay more to have two kinds of meat in the meat combo, you don't actually get much extra. My boyfriend is lucky that I eat like a bird - the surf portion of my shabu set did not seem fresh. For example, the scallop was not sweet and had a slightly sour taste - the sauce bar had no sugar. This disappointed me as I'm accustomed to making a potent garlicky and spicy soy sauce based sauce with a heaping spoonful of sugar - I was very excited to order a side of lotus root using my Yelp checkin offer; however, the lotus root was so thickly sliced that even after an hour of cooking it was still inedible - the house broth was yearning for salt As you can see from my review, I had a very mixed experience and am not sure that I would recommend Simply Shabu to you. I suppose if you have a craving give it a try. Ultimately, I think food like this is best made in an electric wok in your home with a rich and fragrant herbal bone broth. Maybe that's just me though!

Their food is amazing - I've tried the tater tots, crab cake sliders and fried pickles. The fried pickles are genius. They're almost julienned and then coated and fried, so you don't get the whole hot juice mouth squirt experience or the coating falling off experience, which are both typical of fried pickles. Their drinks aren't anything special from what I've had but they're cheap during happy hour, so I'm ok with that. If I want an incredible cocktail id go elsewhere, but to grab a quick drink and some delicious bar food with a small group, this is unbeatable. Service has been great in my experience.

I kinda like your drinks too. In all seriousness, Carroll Place is pretty good Italian gastropub featuring delicious small plates, great mixed drinks and even better pasta. The place can get pretty hectic pretty quickly as it's located in Greenwich Village near NYU. I recommend making a rezzo. Highlights for me include: Truffled Creamy Polenta, Broccoli Rabe, Mascarpone with Clover Honey and Strawberries Bruschetta, Tartufo Pizza, and, my favorite, the Linguine Vongole. This last one, priced at $14, is reminiscent of the Linguine alle vongole that my grandma would make as a kid. Given the price and the quality, I am very happy with it. Most places charge $20+ for a seafood dish like this so it's well worth it. For drinks, try the Ginger Derby and the Bontempo.

There is a fun bar area that is nice and big as well as a dining room, and it looks like they are set up for live music. The bruschetta were my favorite part. We shared them and cut each one up, but I could have scarfed a few down all on my own. The pizza was also good even if not super different from the pizza you might find elsewhere. The only thing to note is that the arancia was almost to spicy to eat even for someone who likes spice. We spent about $300 all-in for 4 people including an app to share, cocktails, and 2 bottles of wine. You could easily spend less. Clearly not worth 5 stars for tiny missteps with the seating and service, but a great place to go.

Insalata Mista - one of the most flavorful appetizer salads I've ever had!!! Trio pasta - You can add this to almost any entree for about $9, really great if you are a big pasta lover like I am.

The restaurant has a nice, intimate front area and a larger patio area in the back through the kitchen.  The back area is very nice in the warmer months, as they have a glass roof in the patio area that lets in a lot of nice sunlight.  The service has always been prompt and excellent. I have only ever gone there for the lunch special, which is an appetizer + 3 unlimited pastas for a little under $20 ($18.95 the last time I went).  The appetizer is a choice of either Caesar salad or a vegetable antipasto platter with seafood salad on the side.  The Caesar salad is quite large, slathered in dressing, and comes with ample croutons.  The antipasto dish has an array of vegetables including eggplant, spaghetti squash, carrots, string beans, mushroom, and some mozzarella as well.  The seafood appetizer has a piece of fish as well as a small octopus and potato salad with a cilantro-lime-onion dressing.  The octopus and potato salad is very tasty, and the vegetables are also great. The pastas that they typically serve are: a mushroom ravioli in a sage-butter sauce, a penne dish with red sauce, and a fettuccine or pappardelle with beef or lamb ragu.  For vegetarians, they offer instead a similar pasta with vegetables, typically with an olive oil base.  The ravioli is very good and buttery.  The penne is usually pretty solid, but nothing special.  The third vegetarian pasta is typically my favorite.  The pastas they have here are very fresh and cooked very well. Overall, Becco is a good Italian restaurant with high quality pastas and superb, prompt service.  I am definitely planning on returning here again for lunch.

Waited 5 minutes before we got greeted. We were starving, but only the small bar menu was being offered. We ordered drinks and an order of french fries. The bloody Mary's were mediocre (wasn't expecting them to be amazing, but could have been better). The fries however took 25 minutes to come out. We asked several times why they were taking so long and it was blamed on the food runner. When they finally arrived they were cold and greasy. We were planning on staying for dinner, but instead paid our bill and went elsewhere.

Definitely would get the streak tartare and the prosciutto tartinette (?) again.

Great variety of French wines, try one of the soecials by glass or botttle! Enjoyed a tasty Agremont on this visit. The starters are focused mostly on bread topped with cheese and other items, such as the goat cheese and sundried tomatoes which was tasty. The mains were so delicious! Coq au vin (chicken) was to die for! And the cassoulet equally tasty. For both, the meat was tender and fell off the bone. Portions were small but sufficient! Dessert was nice and simple, an apple tart that matched well with a glass of sauternes. I would definitely go again. By the way, no reservations that I coukd see and you may have a wait. Not ideal for large groups since it is a small venue. Well worth a visit! Great FRIENDLY and attentive service, even when they are super busy!

But you know what, once you have grilled octopus at a Portuguese restaurant in the ironbound of Newark NJ, nothing else compares. It just doesn't. So maybe my expectations are too high, but it was just good--not great.  That said, if you like grilled octopus it's not a bad appetizer choice. Short rib ravioli was pretty tasty. I liked the dish. Even though it was hand made (I  think), it didn't really have that super fresh handmade texture. But overall a nice , interesting dish. The short rib entree my wife ordered was tasty. She thought it was too saucy, I didn't mind it. It's a very large dish, almost too large unless you're sharing or not ordering any starters. With service, there's a line in my view between very-good-service and asking is-everything-ok every 5 minutes service. Obviously I am nitpicking here, but I'd say the service was a bit over the top. Maybe bc the restaurant wasn't packed, I don't know, but I think the waiter we had could stand to take the foot off the gas pedal a bit. He was a bit too pushy and I didn't appreciate the near forced suggestion of warm bread, which isn't free!  A $4 appetizer is not a big deal since this is not a cheap restaurant, but bread is typically free. Here it's not and the waiter pushing it is in poor taste. Overall: nice , enjoyable meal, but not likely to come back or recommend too strongly. Other short ribs--errr, fish-- in the sea as they say. Note that this is a farm-to-table kind of place so the photos you see on yelp may be dishes that are not being served that day.

507831,235698,4196,2.0,1,2015-01-06,"I tried Shake Shack tonite for 1st time.  The staff consists of university students and they were all pleasant and fun.   The food:  overall disappointing.   I ordered the regular fries, and Shake Stack Burger.  The fries are crinkle cut, boring and bland - not much better than Oreda fries in the freezer at the supermarket. The only choice is plain or with ""cheese sauce"".  The fries could be enhanced if their was seasoning option (like Cajun) or dipping sauces (like spiced ketchup, ranch, horseradish).  Very disappointing except they were fresh cooked. The burger was the beef burger stacked with the portobello mushroom.  The burger was slightly thicker than a pancake.  The mushroom was a disproportionate size to the burger, bun - it was the size of a medium sliced tomato but thicker - it made the sandwich awkward and sloppy. The place was not busy when I arrived so there was no reason my burger should have been so sloppily put together. Lastly, I requested the burger to be cut in 1/2, but apparently the staff is not allowed to handle knives. The knife police were on duty.  So unless Shake Shack orders precut produce (which would explain the high prices), someone in the kitchen is handling a knife.  So if the knife wasn't allowed to be touched, take the spatula that burgers are flipped with and use that!  That was one of the silliest things I ever heard.   Not impressed at all.  All the hype was for nothing.  Not a bad tasting beef burger, bad fries, tiny portobellos however do not make for a good overall meal.   I didn't try any of the shakes or custards.  Maybe I would return to try those and the hot dogs, but that would be about it.

I'm not going to compare it to any of the really great Chinese restaurants I've been lucky enough to experience in my travels, but simply as a local place compared to its peers. Let's face it, the Chinese restaurants in central NJ are mostly so-so. But we found the dishes here to be above average for the area. We were a large group, so we had a decent sampling of the menu, and most of the dishes were prepared well, made a nice presentation, and were tasty. Big plus was the friendly and efficient staff. And the prices are reasonable. Two criticisms, however: the soup was served in such a small bowl that it should be listed as a CUP of soup on the menu. And the cold noodle dish was too starchy, too heavy, and too peanut-buttery. I won't order soup or cold noodles there again, but will be happy to return for the spare ribs and the entree dishes.

We received an apology from the general manager Karen, stating the situation and she wanted to make it up to us. This is pretty understandable because we did come on one of the busiest days of the year(New Year's Day) We came back the following week with open arm. It still was quite busy but the hospitality if the staff was superb. The meal awesome. We got the kobe style course, which I recommend. We started off with the miso soup which was one of the best I've had, especially on a cold winter night. Next was the Gyu-kaki salad, everything was fresh and the dressing was prefect. The edamame was next and it was cooked perfectly with a sprinkle of salt, it wasn't too raw or too cooked, just the way I like. Next, the hot oiled seared salmon, this was my least favorite because it was cooked with ginger and I am not a fan of ginger but my friends did enjoy it. We also had the spicy salmon volcano which was one of my favorite. You can really taste the kick in the spicy salmon and the rice was a perfect neutralizer.   I am a meat person and boy oh boy, it was awesome. The meats did not need any seasoning or sauces. The kobe filet migon was so tender and juicy. And the kobe ribeye was my favorite. You you can see the marbling of the meat and tell that it's going to be a succulent masterpiece. I just wanted more. Although the other meats were really good, these 2 were on a level of its own. We finished off with one if the best deserts I've ever tasted. The madame(lady) m cake was awesomeness on a plate. Layers of crepe and matcha flavored goodness(cream) sits next to a scope of green tea ice cream which was pleasantly beautiful. It wasn't too sweet. Just perfect.

First, she didn't like that we were ordering one sandwich to split (though the guys preparing the meal were more than happy to offer to cut it in half). She asked multiple times if we were getting a second sandwich. Second, she rolled her eyes when we said we were good on drinks.

We are always amazed at the portions for the reasonably cheap prices. The small noodle soups are big portions for just $6.95. The bahn mi sandwich just $4.50 for regular sandwich. The quality is decent. The soup has the best stock and ingredients. The dumplings are my favorite here. The cooks and servers are the nicest folks. As an Asian who grew up in NYC, I think it is hard to find asian food that hasn't been badly Americanized. Living in VT, ethnic foods are better here than Chinese and Japanese standards in the area. This restaurant does a reasonable job to keep it simple and true to the flavors of the ingredients.

The atmosphere is noisy and slightly cramped but it makes the experience intimate and is nothing to complain about. That being said, our meal started off fine... We are college friends who only get to see each other once a year so we were expecting a relaxing meal with lots of our BYOB wine. We started to feel rushed when all 6 of our entrees were brought out within a minute of us taking the last bite of our appetizer. The waiter was nice and attentive but clearly he wanted us to finish. Having been a waitress for 6 years I was confused because all though the small area is crowded, there was no one waiting at the door to be seated. We continued to order dessert and finish our wine even though we felt the pressure to leave because there was still no one waiting. By the time we did finish (probably sat a little under 2 hours total from first being sat to standing up) there was a group waiting, but as we were finished, leaving, and had left over a 20% tip I was still ok with the situation. As we walked out the hostess then said something along the lines of  ""please be more considerate as we needed this table."" I understand they do not make money off of us drinking our alcohol but many BYOB places state on their menu there is a table time limit so guests are aware. If this was the case we either wouldn't have come here or planned our meal accordingly. NEVER in the service industry is saying something like this ok unless MAYBE it comes from a manager.

Maybe I have a mild, undiagnosed case of claustrophobia, but whenever I'm in a tiny cramped restaurant like this, I just can't enjoy my meal.  Especially when you need to pick up and move your entire table for the people next to you to get up from their seat.  Especially when its a cold winter evening and people waiting for their reservation are literally standing directly over you while you try to enjoy your $25 plate of pasta. I totally get that BYOBs need to pack in the guests in order to make up for loss revenue from liquor.  I totally understand.  But I've been to plenty of tiny BYOBs (ahem.. Laurel...) that don't feel the need to sardine-can their guests. As for the food, it was good but definitely nothing better than any of the other Italian places nearby.  I tried the famous pyramid pasta and I wasn't that impressed.  It was tasty, for sure, but nothing that spectacular.  And the butter was just way too much (I'll touch more on that in a minute...)  I thought it was weird that you had to pay extra for olive oil, but we were just fine with the delicious herbed (and gratis) butter.  We also tried a selection of bruschetta, which was a good value for the serving size.  And we tried the special- a braised pork flatbread, which was my favorite part of the meal. I had to drop another star because I got sick on the walk home.  Not sure if it was all the butter or maybe something in one of the dishes was bad?  But regardless, I was not a happy camper post-meal and it put a damper on my entire evening. Mercato has great reviews so maybe this just wasn't the place for me.  I'd suggest maybe visiting on a less busy night or during the summer so you can sit outside?  I don't know- at this price point there are a ton of other BYOBs that I'll be checking out before I come back here.

Picking up a jar wouldn't be a bad idea. The interior is big and spacious. Not nearly as fancy as the Lyndhurst location but still nice. Lots of other slices to chose from as well. Bruno's pizza always keeps a lot of slices handy so you don't have to pick and choose which one you want. Regular pies are good too but not as notable as the Sicilian.   Oh and they are B.Y.O.B.!

The gnocchi was delicious little cloud pillows. They gave you so much of it! The Branzino was a perfect portion of food with potatoes and Swiss chard. Good flavors. Light taste. Nothing creative or mind blowing though. Same goes for the veal which was just okay -some pieces were tender and some a bit cheerier. Same sides. I heard the rack of lamb and huge pork chop are great too. Overall, I would definitely come back to try food again, but on a quieter night.

The others in our party arrived early and were seated upon arrival and were already a bottle deep by the time we arrived. We decided to try the prosciutto with mozz, which was tasty but pretty much a standard that is hard to really mess up. On to the mains. We were a bit confused when ordering. Since they advertise their pasta as having a gluten free option, my wife asked if she can get the gluten free gnocchi, to which our server explained that if its homemade, its not gluten free. So my interpretation means that any gluten free is store bought. Anyways,  My wife had gorgonzola gnocchi, which were delicious but a bit dense. I had the orrichetti w broccoli rabe and sausage. Also very good, pasta was well cooked and the perfect amount of olive oil. So why only 3 stars you ask. 1 star taken away for dessert. We ordered the tiramisu, which was watered down on the bottom and looked like a pancake. I can only assume it was frozen then defrosted quickly. It was awful, ate two bites. Second star went for service, which was fantastic until the end. We were an hour and twenty min into dinner( dessert was on the table), and i asked for a few new wine glasses because we were switching wines. At first, our server told us she couldnt bring us new glasses because the needed to turn our table. ABSURD!  If you really are booking tables with only 90 min windows on NYE, you are crazy. I eat out several times a week and im very conscientious of the need for restaurants to turn tables, but ive never been flat out told ""NO"". She ended up bringing the glasses in the end after I complained, too little to late. Plenty of other great BYOB Italian restaurants in Philly so I doubt I""ll be back.

Unfortunately, Fogo did not really meet my expectations, especially after people have been saying that Fogo is generally the better of the two. (I'm sorry if this sounds more like a comparison of the two, rather than a review of Fogo!) The interior is somewhat dark, and seemed a bit smokey, but was very elegant. One side of the restaurant is a glass window that looks into an apartment/hotel lobby? Parking wasn't too difficult, although I can imagine it can be really tough during busier hours. In general, the food was great. The buffet, although I have heard has been improved from the past, is not nearly as diverse as Chima's, although they did have lox, mushrooms, salads, beefsteak tomatoes, mozzarella - my favorite sides. They also have the cheesy breads, fried polenta (great), garlicky cheesy mashed potatos, and fried plantains. The meat is also great, although I think we were seated in an area where we were the first to get the new meat, so most of my pieces were end pieces. Sad face. In terms of service, it was both great and not great. We were flooded with meat within the first 5 minutes of flipping our cards. What happened was, I was unable to pace myself and so a lot of my meat got cold before I was able to get to it. We were able to request certain cuts of meat, but I noticed that the nicer cuts of meat we requested didn't really come by. It was also a little difficult to get drink refills (also if you cannot pronounce Guarana, be prepared to be a little ashamed as the drink server corrects you), but all in all, we didn't feel neglected at all. They gave us a flan on the house for my dad's birthday, which we greatly appreciated. But then they charged us for alcoholic drinks we did not order. So it was a see-saw of a night. I don't know if I'd come back here. I feel much more comfortable at Chimas and far less stuffy, and I didn't feel that one place trumped the other in any way. Both are okay places to me.

When we were finished with salad we flipped our card over to green and it was on from there. The steak just kept rolling in until we flipped the card back over to red. They cook the meats so that there is a type for each preference.  The filet was melt in your mouth and the chicken was fall off the bone. We also liked the parmesan crusted pork.  For dessert we ordered the creme brulee which was your typical creme brulee, nothing special.

Let's just say I took the most impossible steak and potatoes only guy here and made him a fan.  Favorite menu item are between the soups and the shrimp basil. I like that the dishes are normal enough to appeal to mass array of taste buds but have enough flavor and spice to clearly separate the quality/taste from your local Asian store. Service has always been fast, friendly and polite and I believe they work inclusively and there is no one particular server assigned to your table - everyone helps. This is a fair sized quaint restaurant that I really enjoy returning to time after time. For no particular reason I prefer this location over the center city one. The drinks here are okay - if there's nothing you want off the menu they do have a full bar option. My friends and I almost always always split the flaming volcano which is always one of my favorite fun fruity drinks to get either here or hibachi. Overall, this restaurant really adds to the appeal of the Cedar Park area. It took me way too long to try this place out so if you're like me and in the fence, don't be - just go!

For me, all three hold their own charms, and I never say ""no"" to eating at any of them.  If pressed, I put Monte Alban's food at the top, slightly edging out Coyote Flaco. Service is warm, friendly, and casual, like you are at someone's home.  Ambiance isn't fancy but it's homey and clean.  The focus here is on the food. Order a beer, the margaritas are ""meh"" and made from one of those day-glo mixes.  The (heavily Mexican) beer list, however, is atypically robust.   The chips and salsa are definitely worth eating.  Ask for their hot sauce if you're a fan of spice.  It is smokey, clearly house-made, and amazing.  I can't get enough of it. I typically get tacos, which are authentic and delicious, but dining partners have always raved about their moles, burritos, and tamales. Monte Alban isn't just a West End gem, it's a Hartford gem.

GARGANELLI--I really wanted to like this dish but it FELL SHORT for me. I'm not a fan of STRINGY PORK; while it was TENDER and FLAVORFUL, the texture just wasn't right. It was HARD TO DISPERSE the meat amongst the pasta. The pasta was a tad OVERCOOKED so it didn't hold it's supposed-to-be cylindrical shape. The LEMON RICOTTA was SUBTLE but delightful in a fresh type of way. WHOLE WHEAT 'LASAGNA'--I loved everything about this dish BESIDES THE PASTA, which is a bummer because I was trying to continue my whole wheat pasta kick. I didn't like the CRUSTY and CRUNCHY OVERLAY of pasta. It was SPONGY, SLOPPY, but I overlooked the pasta because the FILLINGS were DELICIOUS and the flavors were balanced quite well. GRANDMA PIE--the MOST POPULAR item on their menu apparently and it's the dish that'll make your eyes go (o.o) when they lay it down. It was good but WASN'T THE BEST grandma I've had. I think my MAJOR GRIPE would be the DOUGH. The menu notes that it's UNBLEACHED and UNBROMATED, a combination that is organic and doesn't contain carcinogens that might harm your body. I appreciate GG's concern for our health but the TASTE and TEXTURE of the dough was COMPROMISED; I just prefer plain old flour! We had a total of two waitresses who served our table; the first one was a sweetheart but the second one gave off a mean bully kind of vibe that made my experience slightly uncomfortable. When we ordered the pasta dishes in the small size, her tone was questioning like ""ruguysfreakingserious?"". Even though her large size recommendation was right, it could've been said it a different way that was less pressuring. **Overall, I'd like to come back and try another pizza and the ice cream sandwich for dessert.

All have been good, though interestingly, this isn't the place where I crave to eat when I come back and visit my old Burlington friends. Maybe that's because it's gained such a tourist-y reputation. Other things to note: if you come at prime dinner or lunch time, especially on a weekend, be prepared to wait!

Our soups were warm and our onion rings were attractively presented and were the best I have ever tasted (guess we were not looking for healthy food).   I was rather stunned to receive an ice cold hot pastrami sandwich.  I mean the top of the bun was a tad warm but can you imagine the diner down the road getting this wring?  My son insisted that his breakfast plate was hit.  I poked around my sandwich thinking that this never even made it to the grill.  It took time to get it returned to me hot.  Big mistake for the price and I worried that the cook might take offense to the return. So I'm not sure what happened here.  If you have to eat ""Vermont farm "" try this place.  But I will try the cute yellow diner on my next trip.  A local told me is it quite good.   Perhaps the college gal has a vested interest in the property across the street.  I feel it was overpriced.  I think there is better ambience elsewhere.  It is not a place that I would need to return to with all the other options around Burlington.

Omega looks like a typical diner on the inside. Old-fashioned booths, a front-desk to pay at and music playing listlessly in the background. Our waitress wasn't very friendly, and seemed impatient the whole time she was serving us. I didn't like the overall feel of the place. The menu is typical too--sandwiches, entrees and sides. I was surprised by the priciness. I'm used to diners being cheaper than normal sit-down restaurants, but Omega prices everything about the same. My food took a while to come, even though there was only one other table in the diner and our orders were quite simple. The food is nothing special either. In fact, it didn't taste like diner-restaurant food, but rather a quick lunch you would pack yourself for school or work. I was very disappointed with my sandwich. The ingredients weren't fresh and the bread didn't seem toasted. The food generally doesn't have a lot of taste, which is uncommon for late night food. I wouldn't recommend Omega unless everything else is closed and you need a place to eat. There are much better diners and late-night places within the vicinity with more reasonable prices and much better food.

The waitress did not want to be there that day, or worse this is what the service has become here. Did not see a waiter or waitress during our breakfast ask us if we wanted anything else, so we went without. If you want more tea or another beverage it is typical to expect the waiter or waitress to check in on you.

This place never appealed to me enough to plan ahead for it, but I had been disappointed that the two or three times I had tried, the hostess told me to expect at least an hour long wait. However, I was able to sneak right in to a table on a Sunday night and was pleasantly surprised. The hotpot was tasty, presented in a simple, yet elegant way retaining a lot of the character of my admittedly uninformed perceptions of the setting of a hearty Japanese meal. Anyways, the food was very nice. If I had to critique anything, it would be that the tonsoku appetizer actually didn't have much meat on it. This was especially disappointing because the sauce it was glazed in was delicious. As for the hotpot, we got the one named after the restaurant and were not disappointed. Spicy enough to cause some forehead sweat and make the cold beer improve, and the greens tasted rich and fresh. All in all, not amazing, but I admire the quality and unpretentiousness of Hakata Tonton. It is very good food, executed with humility. And for dessert when you're paying the check, you'll be reminded (if you did not first see it on the menu), that no tip/service charge is expected as the waitstaff are compensated an appropriate wage without gratuities. Although they attribute it to Japanese custom, I wish that more restaurants would adopt this practice in NYC. The service was excellent, but not in the aggressively friendly/tip hungry way...just professionals who knew how to attend to a table. You really can't ask for a whole lot more in a restaurant.

We've been meaning to try Russet and figured that this was the perfect time to try the dishes offered by the husband-wife team of Chef Andrew Wood and Pastry Chef Kristin Wood. Russet's a BYO and one of the few that takes credit cards. And in the spirit of NYE, we decided to bring a bottle of our favorite champagne. NYE Menu [$75 pp] Bread Service The rustic bread was nice, but served cold - perhaps it's because we had a 10PM reservation. The pat of butter was at room temp, which I appreciated. Heirloom Squash Turnover Caramelized onions, pumpkin seed-arugula pesto, black walnut The GF started off with the squash turnover, which was buttery and delicious. The crisp texture of the turnover and the black walnuts contrasted nicely with the rich caramelized onions and squash. The pumpkin seed-arugula helped to brighten up each bite. Oyster and Scallop Gratin Celery, chervil, shallot I went with the oyster-scallop gratin, which was served on a bed of salt. The mix of shallots, cooked celery, chopped oysters, and scallop was nice - briny and oceanic, with the bread crumbs providing some texture. The chervil helped to add some herbaceousness. House-Cured Prosciutto Local quince, grissini, pickled mustard seeds I appreciate that Chef Wood house-cures his own ham and the prosciutto here was luscious and teeming with the porcine goodness you're looking for. The balance of the local quince and the pickled mustard seeds provided some brightness against the heft of the prosciutto. Seared Foie Gras [+ $10 supplement] Blood orange, thyme, buckwheat-meyer lemon madeleine The foie gras was prototypically buttery and rich, with the blood orange providing the proper foil. But the real star? The buckwheat meyer lemon madeleines churned out from Chef Kristin Wood. They were buttery, subtly sweet, and had a wonderfully crumbly texture. Woodland Jewel Mushroom Raviolo Ricotta, Loc Tran's egg The GF and I were looking forward to an oozing egg in the middle of her raviolo, but alas - it was only filled with ricotta, without much seasoning. The pasta itself could have used another minute in the water - more starchy than al dente. The sauce had some depth, but overall, each bite lacked seasoning. Hand-Rolled Pici with Perigord Black Truffle [+ $18 supplement] Roasted langoustines, leeks, pistachio, sauce Americaine   Russet was offering a Perigord black truffle supplement for the pasta dishes so I opted to top off my pici pasta. A generous portion of earthy truffles was provided and though I prefer black truffles to be cooked to release more of that intense aroma, this added some nice depth. The deliciously, buttery veloute coated the pasta well. However, while the langoustine claw was meaty and well-cooked, there were more than a few pieces of shell found interspersed in the pasta. I normally don't bring much attention to gaffes such as this, but it was so egregious, I did cordially mention it to the server. Alas, either the server didn't understand that I was pointing at about 4 pieces of shell on my bread plate or he couldn't care less ... Seared Branzino Caramelized parsnips, grilled vidalia onions, kale, parsley jus For her main, the GF went with the fish. Online, the offering appeared to be halibut with uni, but for actual dinner service, branzino was on offer sans uni. Regardless, the fish was moist, delicate, and flavorful. The caramelized parsnips and grilled vidalia onions added some texture and sweet, butteriness to each bite. Slow-Roasted Border Springs Lamb Floriani corn polenta, romanesco, green coriander, tomato fondue I don't know if it's because it was 11PM on NYE or it was a NYE menu, but unfortunately my main was a disaster. I was really looking forward to the ""slow roasted"" lamb, which was incinerated beyond belief. About half of it seemed fried and the meat was not tender at all. The romanesco was bright and the corn polenta cake was decent however. But momma didn't raise a vegetarian - disappointing. Bittersweet Chocolate Budino Cranberry compote, cassis cream Luckily though, pastry chef Kristin Wood salvaged the rest of the meal. The GF ordered the budino based on her infatuation with Chef Turney's salted caramel budino. This iteration was in cake form, with a nicely bittersweet chocolate ganache within. The cranberry compote provided acidity to balance the richness of the cake and the chocolate, with the currant cream providing some lightness. Mascarpone Panna Cotta Blood orange, Grand Marnier syrup, oat crisp My mascarpone panna cotta had the proper jiggle and was light and subtly sweet. The caramelized sugar oat crisp had nice texture and the Grand Marnier syrup wasn't overpowering or cloyingly sweet. The blood orange provided a bright tartness that was an appropriate end to the mea

Favorites are: The cornbread starters that are complimentary the oysters- all of them (baked/fried/and raw- my choice is the chilled pemaquid oysters) the whitefish roe with grilled bread- FAVORITE, could eat this multiple times (and have) beet salad- refreshing and a nice counter to all the seafood and meat the braised beef- flavorful and filling, but not heavy Dessert- we had were the chocolate peanut butter tart, which was rich, but this was countered by its smaller size, as well as the bourbon caramel ice cream with which it was paired.

I ordered 2 pork sliders with a side of mac n' cheese and the Harlem potato salad. I really hate to say that I was disappointed because I really do like this place but its the truth.

Now that I eat meat and have been to a bunch of NYC's BBQ places, I was curious to go back. I was pleasantly surprised. Sure, it's not the best BBQ in NYC, but it was good. I got the appetizer sampler (which wasn't anything special, but was fine), brisket, ribs, collards, mashed potatoes, sausage, and corn bread. I was happy with our food. They did a great job of coming up with a menu where there's something for most people. If you have some picky eaters, this is a good choice. They have fewer vegetarian options than I remember, but more than any other BBQ place. They have a gluten-free and allergen-free menu, too. Perhaps that's why there were so many groups here for special occasions - it's a spot everyone can agree on. The service was amazing. It was like they hired only the best Trader Joe's employees. I thought the table behind us was BFF with the waitress, only to realize later that they were totally just a random table of tourists. Our waitress was also great, but in a more normal friendly small talk kind of way, which is what I prefer. It's a little on the high side for people on a budget, but it's cheap for BBQ, so there were a ton of families out for a nice night out. Which is perhaps why everyone just seemed so happy to be there.

Went in on a rainy weekday night and the place was almost empty so I sat at the bar which was also empty except for 3 or 4 people. I asked the guy behind the bar for a menu but he said he couldn't give me one and pointed to the girl down at the other end of the bar who was the bartender and was chatting with other employees. The guy then left, walked out of the bar, and didn't even ask her to give me a menu. After chatting for a few more minutes the bartender came down and finally gave me a menu, then returned to the other end of the bar to continue her chat. 10 minutes later she still hadn't returned to take my order though the other guy came back. I asked him if he could take my order but he said no and again pointed to the bartender who had pretty much forgotten I existed. He walked away again, left the bar, and again didn't bother to say anything to the bartender. So I sat another 10 minutes waiting for the bartender to finish her socializing down at the end of the bar. She finally came back and took my order, 25 minutes after I had sat down. When I finished my dinner I had to wait another 20 minutes for her to reappear and give me my check. Then another 10 minutes for her to come back and take my money, followed by another 5 minutes to get change. And all this while the place was totally empty. At one point I almost got up and walked out on the check - the service was THAT bad. The staff here clearly don't care about the patrons judging by this kind of service - an hour and a half spent to get a plate of food in an empty restaurant is just totally unacceptable.

There was one server, who seemed to be running the show all on her own. When she seated me, I informed her that I would have one person joining me...but she never brought me a second menu. Once my lunch guest arrived, we sat at the table for maybe 10-15 minutes before the server finally came and took out order. We ordered our food and two coffees. The coffees never came until we asked her if they were coming (by this time we were almost done with our meal and she asked if we needed anything else). The entire time the owner(?)/manager(?) was plopped in front of his laptop at a table behind us. Our server was very sweet, but seemed like she was either new or overwhelmed. The owner/manager didn't get up once to assist her, though he got up once and said something to her before plopping back down again. (I'm assuming he asked her to bring us napkins, as that is precisely what she did after he spoke to her. ) My guest and I are both servers ourselves, so we both understand what good service looks like and that sometimes servers can have ""off"" days. That doesn't seem to be the case here. It seems like management is lacking/unprofessional, and that's sad, as it will keep me from coming back.

My family and I woke this morning excited about the idea of sharing the dim sum experience with our 4 kids (age range 11-13). We eat dim sum once a year so it's a big deal for us. When there was a 20 minute wait for our first choice, it was my great idea to try the new craze in Chinatown, Dim Sum Garden. I'd walked by this place several times and always saw it packed; thought to myself, ""this place must be good. Can't wait to try it."" So the 7 of us go in and are immediately greeted by a grumpy, impatient waitress. We were disappointed that we wouldn't get to share with our kids the full dim sum experience but since we were already seated, proceeded to order. In summary, the food is HORRENDOUS!! What are you all eating in here that you come in hoards? Don't believe the hype! I encourage you to not try and convince yourself that this food is good. It REALLY isn't! But to each his own.

The soup dumplings were my favorite and tasted like the ones at Joe's Shanghai in NYC. My dumpling expert gave her seal of approval as she slurped up the delicious broth with considerable finesse. Meanwhile broth ended up all over my face and shirt but maybe someday I will be as suave as her. Probably not. Other highlights: scallion pancakes (crispy and salty), shao mai, and shrimp dumplings. I didn't care too much for the napa and pork, I found the dumpling skin to be way too thick. But what do I know. Overall, a solid place for dim sum. Don't miss the soup dumplings!

If you've never had Shanghainese dim sum (or dim sum in general) and you want a straightforward introduction, this is a good place to try. The menus are in English with pictures, you order from menu rather than from cart, the staff all speak excellent English and were quite attentive when we visited (I think sometimes the carts and language barriers at dim sum can be intimidating to newcomers). There are also more than the usual number of options for vegetarians. The beef brisket noodles were my favorite dish of the day -- the flavors were good, the noodles were fresh (maybe slightly overcooked, but still great), the portion size was generous. We split this between three people and felt like we had enough without getting too full for the rest of the food. The dumplings were all fine. The dough was a little thicker than I prefer, which I suppose was helpful for the soup dumplings, since it made it easier to keep them intact, but it felt slightly off-balance for the filling to dough ratio to me. The soup dumplings were also significantly larger than the spoons meant to contain them, which made for some messiness (but there should always be at least a little messiness to the slurpy soup dumplings, so this wasn't a huge deal). The dumpling sauce and vinegar were both great. So yeah -- no complaints, but nothing life-changing. Probably closer to 3.5 stars.

The service was pretty good, not the quickest, but they were friendly. This place got very crowded for lunch, with almost every table taken. The prices are very reasonable, and the menu resembled a Shanghainese approach to Chinese food. We decided to get a lot of dim sum appetizers. We got the pork soup dumplings, which were very reasonable, at about 70 cents a dumpling, $5.75 for 8. The skin was a bit thick, but they didn't break, the soup inside was sweet and savory, and the entire dumplings looked amazing. The pan fried dumplings were extremely moist and wasn't oily at all. The potato cakes were delicious. The duck noodle soup was great. The duck was cooked well and the meat fell off of the bone. The noodles were the right texture and the noodles absorbed the soup well. The bok choy was great too. It was a cheap and delicious lunch.

My partner got the enchiladas which were delicious. Overall, really solid fresh good food. Also service -- the sever/bartender was probably one of the best servers I've had in a long time.

Moving on, though, it was pretty good.  The meat quality could have been a little cleaner and leaner.  There was a few chewy weird pieces, which to me is the ultimate sin on any cheesesteak.  Besides that, good flavor, good size but not the best.  That's not a matter of debate or opinion when the meat has gristle.  Also, a lot of people get fooled by SIZE over quality, especially in the hood.  That is the case here.  Keep that in mind.  Another complaint would be that my steak literally had equal parts steak and onion.  Wayyyyy too many onions and I love onions. Overall I give it a 7/10.  I would eat it again. I see people comparing this to Pat's and Geno's.  Forget those places.  The best steaks in the city are: Steve's, Mama's (my personal favorite), John's, Philips's, and By George in the Reading Terminal.

526922,17116,1530,3.0,1,2015-01-05,"A few friends and I found ourselves in LIC on a weekend afternoon, and after agreeing to a late brunch, headed over to Casa Enrique. They had been there prior for dinner, but as it was my first time, was curious about the restaurant which had just received a Michelin star for the new year. First opened in 2012 by Chef Cosme Aguilar, who worked nearly a decade in the kitchens of the (now closed West Village) Cafe Henri, it's since evolved into a neighborhood gem, serving elevated takes on Mexican cuisine. We were seated in the outdoor dining area that had an enclosed roof overhead to accommodate the approaching cold weather. Glasses of water were filled and our table was immediately given a small bowl of chicharrines (also known as duros), a Mexican street snack that consists of wheat flour that's deep fried until it resembles a puffed-up form of macaroni. The menu is a generous melding of egg-based ""brunch"" dishes and heartier ""lunch"" dishes, so it took a solid few minutes until all three of us were satisfied with our choices. To begin, we started off on a guacamole for the group, which is served with a side of totopos, a crisp chip that was nearly identical to the tortilla chip, but is made with nixtamalized corn masa, giving it a grittier texture. The guacamole was delicious, a generous serving of mashed avocado, onion, cilantro, jalapeño and tomato, was aromatic, well-seasoned, and had just the right acidity to balance out the creaminess. Needless to say, we quickly emptied out the bowl before our main courses arrived. Both my friend and I ended up deciding on the Huevos a la Mexicana, a traditional Mexican dish that cooked scrambled eggs with onions, tomatoes, and jalapenos with a side of black beans and potatoes. The eggs were soft, almost fluffy, but it was in this dish that I found the lack of flavor to be quite the detriment. We had to ask for salt from our server to make our dishes more palatable, and I would have appreciated a little more spice in my plate. While each of the components were cooked well, the underseasoning definitely detracted from the overall taste. Perhaps it's not fair to judge a restaurant on a meal at brunch, and a simple one at that, but I would also argue that good restaurants should know how to do the basic dishes well. Nonetheless, I would return to Casa Enrique for dinner, as many of my friends have nothing but positive words to say about the restaurant.

The decor paired with the set up of the high top tables and round booths gave us a good impression of what was ahead. The drinks were delightfully prepared, refreshing (old fashion and fleur de lis), and paired well with the lamb meatballs which were nothing short of delectable. For our meals, my husband chose the short ribs that were accompanied by root vegetables and mashed potatoes and I ordered the quinoa salad with a hanger steak. After our food arrived, I quickly took one bite as I was so eager to try the beautifully presented plate. The words out of my mouth were, ""This is one of the best things I've ever tasted."" My husband was just as satisfied with his meal as well. My hanger steak, cooked well, was still juicy, tender, and could be sliced with a butter knife. I made sure not to leave a speck on my plate and would have licked it clean had that been appropriate at the time. My list of ""Best Meals I've Ever Consumed"" is now a short, yet well-deserved, list of two (P&Q accompanied by Kimo's in Maui). My husband and I left there completely satisfied with everything from the atmosphere, wait staff, managers, and, most definitely, the food. Although we won't be able to visit as often as we'd like, we're not too far away in Boston and will make Parker & Quinn a must-visit whenever we're in the city.

On to the food- this was delicious and super affordable for mid-town Manhattan.  We weren't super hungry (having eaten our way through Eataly for lunch), so started with the marinated olives.  They were served in a lemon and fresh garlic marinade and were absolutely outstanding, the perfect small bite to start the meal.  I ordered the fig and procuitto flat bread with gorgonzola.  It was excellent- light yet filling, and extremely flavorful.  Others in our party ordered the BBQ chicken flat bread- also extremely flavorful yet simple, a little heavier than my flat bread, the Prime Rib sandwich with pepperoncini- this was served with an arugula side salad that was just perfection and my friend (who said she wasn't very hungry when ordering) absolutely inhaled the sandwich, another friend ordered the P&Q grilled cheese (also with the awesome salad that I could eat every single day) and loved it. All in all a really excellent find, just a little off the beaten path yet super convenient to shopping in mid-town.  I highly recommend it for locals and tourists alike, anyone looking for an affordable, relaxed and very tasty meal near Herald Square will love this place.

However, I've had better service in the midst of all the chaos. We opted out to go to the downstairs part of the restaurant since it seemed to have a shorter wait! The actual restaurant part upstairs was already on a 90 mins wait (We went around 8 p.m. ish on a Saturday). When we went downstairs, at first it was a 60 min wait, but fortunately (the only fortunate part of the whole experience) the people who were waiting before us didn't answer their phone so we got sat at the bar area right away! There are table seats downstairs with servers-- which I feel like if we were there, it may have been a different experience! (NOTE: Your cell will not work down stairs-- probably a reason why the hostess had to use the landline. They also don't have WIFI!!) Whoever the bar guy was, I was shocked on his demeanor, attitude and blatant rudeness. I will say that he did fill our waters with promptness though-- as well as the rest of the bar area (which was about 8-10). My friend and I were sitting down for a while (15 mins) with menus, and asked ""excuse me"" so we can order. I'm going to give him, that although he was busy too, he really didn't have to put a hand up with his finger like we were back in grade school. He came up and we ordered, then he wanted the menus back-- and I told him that can we keep one since we were going to order more and he said, ""Well I'll give it back to you when you need it"". Again, totally understandable if he needed it for when people sat down--- which I was surprised when he wasn't even the one to give any of us menus, because you know I would be actually looking to see if he needed the menus. After we ordered, we were talking and the food came out. It was the udon with the spicy fish flavor--- extremely salty. We had to put some water down in it to even it out. The meat was good, I think maybe just the broth. We also noticed, although he gave us two bowls for us to share, just one spoon. So a few minutes later, I asked him if he could give us an extra spoon. He CLEARLY rolled his eyes and went in to give us a spoon. At this point, my friend and I looked at each other and was like--- did we do something wrong? He said they didn't have extra so that's why he gave us this metal spoon rather than the spoon you're supposed to use. (If you know which spoons I'm talking about-- it's shorter, usually found in Asian restaurants, especially pho places). About 20 mins later (when it didn't even look like we were done), the bar guy asked if we wanted to order anything else. I told him, not yet-- and he rudely told us ""To let you know, sitting here, you have a $10 minimum each and you're away about $3"". Again, I would have been totally fine with this-- had I not been rudely told... So we ordered a hot sake-- which was nice and hot. Careful when you first get it because it's sooo hot! The hostess was nice and the vibe is what you would see during the winter holiday, Christmas season (although after Christmas but before New Years). You can tell I did NOT like the bartender guy--- I was relieved that another person came toward the end to switch with him. Too bad it was only for about 10 mins or so when we had to pay for the check. Two stars because of the other bartender and the food wasn't horrible. I don't think we'll ever be back again.

Their chicken gizzard (fried), which I normally don't care for, is quite enjoyable and yes, the mentai pasta that has rave reviews is deliciously creamy spaghetti. I also enjoyed the age tofu and it's quite a large portion as well. Yaki udon is also good if you're looking for another noodle. I'd opt out for the kimchee fried rice, just not enough flavor. Best part? $8 unfiltered sake bottle! If you're looking for something sweeter, the peach sparkling sake is interesting and super sweet. It's a small place so expect to wait a bit. First time was an hour, second time was about 30 minutes, so I think it just depends on the day and time and the weather outside...

Our server was super nice and the food was just awesome. We ordered: Sukiyaki udon: perfect balance of flavours, not too sweet or salty with a hint of sake. Beef was tendor and noodles were chewy. Loved this. 5/5 Takoyaki: I've had better in Toronto, but this wasn't bad, the texture was a bit on the mushy side. 3/5 Soft shell crab: Hands down highlight of our meal! So crispy and light but not overly greasy! Soooo good. 5/5 Skewer set: everything was good expect the peppers, way too spicy. Sucks that they don't let you change it. 3/5 Peach soju: went perfectly with our meal! Tastes like peach soda. Overall, this is on the pricey side but the food was so good and the server was nice.

The atmosphere is quite glamorous, which is to be expected at a ritzy hotel bar. The restaurant seems like a very nice place to go with family, or a special someone, but we just took a seat at the bar. The place is positively crawling with young professionals and older executive types. Very business. The bartender was wonderful. He was very friendly (working for those tips) and whipped up a couple of great cocktails. My favorite was the Lavender Martini--not on the menu, just something he created on the spot. Great spot for when you're in the mood to be overly classy for an evening.

I discovered the Chopping Block  when they first opened months ago and was really excited to have a lunch option with interesting combinations in FiDi. Well that is no longer the case. I came in today with the intent of ordering the Mexicali salad. I've had it before and it was really tasty. If that wasn't available, I was going to order the Cheddar BLT salad (also quite good). However, I was informed that Chopping Block only has 5 options now that can be made as a sandwich or a salad. The cashier said she was just informed this morning and she had no idea how long this ""new"" menu would last (Ugh - really!?). The Fuego, ham and swiss, roast beef, eggplant, and something else (that I have now forgot as it was uninteresting to me) are the only things available. Some of these options sound pretty disgusting as a salad and that's what I was craving. I have come here previously to find them closed (unexpectedly as the website made no mention) and one time they were OUT of lettuce at lunch time. Who runs out of lettuce at a salad and sandwich place?!!? And if you did run out, go buy more! What can they even make without lettuce?! This place is terribly mismanaged and I won't be back. They get the extra star because the food (the few times I actually got to eat here) was great. It's just not worth the hassle especially for the high prices. Save yourself the trouble and skip it.

536647,243218,1302,2.0,1,2015-01-06,"Let me start off by saying that the service I experienced deserves 5 stars. I don't include service in my reviews since I don't think a good/bad waiter(s) should affect a rating for a restaurant but all the service workers were top-notch. First thing I didn't like is that the price on the website is 48 dollars but the actual price I paid was 54 dollars (both not including tax/tip). I'm assuming it was recently raised but it's still just deceptive. If you have the time/energy to print up a new menu with the new price, you should be able to update your website, especially since you update the website every week to put up the new menu (that isn't very accurate, keep reading). It's one of those things that a customer obviously doesn't mention and you're not going to leave over 6 dollars but there's still no reason for it to happen and leaves a bad taste. Second thing is that over half the menu is different from the website's menu. Substitutions happen of course (and website says this) but the majority of the menu changed. So I made a reservation expecting a certain menu and price and I showed up and it was a mostly different menu at a higher price. Past that, the food was solid though unspectacular. It definitely comes across as a ""home cooked"" traditional meal but that also means that it's not very special or high end. I liked that they offered small plates at first to let me taste a variety of things. Those small plates were really the highlights. The first course gives no choice and was farmer's dumplings with swiss chard/cured pork something and was, again, solid though unspectacular. The mains (ones I tried were bass and pork loin) were similarly solid but not amazing and the desserts were the same. Given the other restaurants available, I wouldn't come again, but I didn't have a bad experience either. Normally I would give the restaurant 3 stars but with the dishonest price and significant menu changes I lowered it to a 2.

I tried a bite and found it to be a bit fishy. Also the brussel sprouts were slick / soggy which I just personally don't prefer preparation wise. beef wellington  dauphine potatoes and winter greens - I got this and also was sadly underwhelmed. The beef itself had very little flavor and the wellington preparation was hit or miss. Some bites were well balanced with the croissant crust and a very light layer of filling while other parts of the filling were very greasy and unappetizing. Dessert consisted of 2 bites - a chocolate cake and a puff pastry with caramelized sugar both sitting in a coffee flavored liquid. they also brought a selection of chocolate to end the meal that were all very tasty. Overall again we were disappointed as we had so looked forward to dining there. Maybe we just didn't catch the right menu for us - a chance you take with a rotating menu!

538094,61447,1909,1.0,1,2015-01-03,"Having been a long time fan of the Red Cat, I recently had the most disappointing dining experience over NewYears Eve. I had a 10pm reservation that the restaurant made me secure with a credit card.  I have no problem doing this, however, you best ensure that you have a table promptly waiting for me upon arrival. As usual, my guest and I arrived at 10pm promptly.  We were greeted by a loud noisy crowd in the overstuffed bar area and by a scattered hostess, who told us that there would be a slight delay for our table, without giving any additional insight.  Right away based upon the pandemonium, it was quite apparent that the restaurant had overbooked, and I as the lucky guest who would have to deal with the aftermath. My guest and I fought our way down to the end of the crowded bar to wait patiently for our reserved and credit card confirmed table.  45 minutes stretched by with only a few words of feedback from the hostess and manager, who kept trying to assure us that our table would be ready at any minute.  In all honesty, if the restaurant had been honest and the  only available  reservation had been for 11pm, I would have dined elsewhere. We were finally seated and by 11pm, my guest and I received our menus and some water.  I was hoping to be finished with dinner by midnight, so that we could toast in the new year with a glass of champagne, but alas, that obviously was not going to happen.  The infuriating part is that if you were a walk-in at 10:45pm or at 11:00pm, you could be seated promptly.  So much for having a reservation..... Once seated, we ended up with a very nervous server, who was semi-attentive.  We were presented with an amuse-bouche as an apology.  It was a tiny salty, puff pastry with crème fraîche and caviar, which seemed to be more of an insult than an apology. Yuck, Cutting to the food, which consisted of four courses was decent in all honesty.  The best dish was the tenderloin by far and the duck was done very nicely.  We were not a fan of the fried oysters, but the beef tar tar and the lobster salad were tasty.  The profiteroles were a total fail as the coffee ice cream did not compliment the puff pastry very well.   Of course midnight came, and we still had dirty dinner dishes in front of us.  Yeah....nice way to ring in the new year.  At this point the entire staff seemed to abdicate their responsibilities.  A rotund female chef wandered into the dining room with a large glass of brown alcohol.  The servers all went absentee.  So much for $90 a head plus drinks dining experience! Our server finally came over to us and told us that he had to leave in order to go spend time with his kid,  Yeah.....real nice for the customer.  We were handed off to a server named Susan, who not only screwed up our dessert order, but subsequently screwed up our check.  We got the full on ""sloppy seconds"" treatment.   When the desserts were delivered to our table they were mixed up with the table next to us.  It was a total rank amateur move by a restaurant that likes to pretend that it I can provide a first rate dining experience.. In hindsight, I thoroughly and utterly regret spending my New Years Eve at the Red Cat.  Management did not respect its customers enough to give them a top end experience, especially given what was being charged.  As a result, they have lost a customer for life, and I will share this poor experience with as many people as possible. I believe that the Red Cat will soon be going the path of its sister restaurant, the Harrison. R.I.P

You pay $130 for the paperweight, but the box comes free. This may sound like a bad deal (it is), but this pairing is the perfect insight into Simon Pearce's restaurant. A disclaimer: after spending some time watching the craftsmen at work I fully appreciate the value of a functional, handblown glass product, and am in no way saying that their glass is worthless--expensive, yes; worthless, no. The polar bear, on the other hand, is worthless. If I saw one at a stranger's house I would judge him. If I received it as a gift I would return it. If I couldn't return my glass bear I would give it to someone else--someone with expensive, but terrible taste. This is the kind of decoration your obnoxious boss has on his desk: ""nice, isn't it?"" He indicates with a smug tilt of his head, ""it's a Simon Pearce, you know."" The custom box, like the beautiful setting of the restaurant, exists to send a message: I contain something expensive, shiny, and worthless. I exist for status. If you woke up this morning thinking, ""I'd like to spend a lot of money on something incredibly unsatisfying,"" then you know where to go. My last (last as is not first, but also as in last) visit less than a week ago prompted me to write this review. The fish was cooked well, but was mostly flavorless. The cocktail was boring, the three desserts my party ordered borderline inedible, and the coffee was so bitter and contained so much sediment I would have returned it if I didn't want to leave. And then comes the vermont cheddar soup... oh god, the Vermont cheddar soup. For those of you who enjoyed the soup I can save you the 100 dollars you'll waste by returning for another meal: it's 80% heavy cream and 20% cheese. There. Go make it. It is sickeningly rich, cloyingly thick, and not worth putting in your mouth. Our waiter was obnoxious as well, but we'll leave him out of the equation out of fairness to the restaurant. As other reviewers have commented, the restaurant is as carefully crafted as a glass polar bear. As most other reviewers have not mentioned: its food is just as underwhelming. A few high points of the meal were the tasty bread and the mulled apple cider; it wasn't all bad, but none of it was very good. The lesson here is this: a mediocre product in an expensive looking box is worse than the same quality in an appropriately priced package. Definitely visit the glass blowers, but save your money and eat at any other restaurant in the area.

Buttermilk fried chicken ($19) was A+ with a breast and leg fried in a wonderfully seasoned batter.  Moist, flavorful throughout and refreshingly light on oil, we all felt stuffed in a good way after finishing our plates which doesn't happen often after a gutbuster Southern meal.  This comes with a wedge of lettuce dressed with tasty pomegranate seeds and almonds drenched in too much ranch dressing.   Biscuits: tremendous, but they'd better be at $6 for 2 biscuits!  These can be served with honey butter if you want to go full-on fatty.  Just make sure they are brought out warm, cold biscuits are sad. Shrimp & grits: a little spicy, the flavor variety was a welcome surprise for grits. The $18 entree portion doesn't look large but it's quite filling.  We didn't care for the andouille sausage, it was oily and distracting from all the good things going on in that bowl. Unfortunately we had some trouble understanding our server... when we saw other tables being served biscuits before their meals arrived, we asked if they were included and she said ""yes, I will bring them out later"".  Thirty minutes later, our entrees were served and we had to tell another member of the staff we were still waiting on bread.  Four biscuits eventually came out for three people, then we were charged for 2 orders, one of which was taken off the bill after we explained the miscommunication.  So that was an awkward end to an otherwise really enjoyable meal.  Those ginger cookies that come with the check helped us get over it pretty fast - I would come back for sure.

540217,245196,4529,3.0,1,2015-01-02,"High point- menu. Low point- service. First, the good- I was very pleased with the menu. It's traditional Italian and I don't mean chicken parmesan. I'm a foodie, and this menu was super fun to read. I was with a friend who's a conservative eater so we steered away from some of the more interesting options but I'd like to go back with someone who's a more adventurous eater. The eggplant compote that comes with the bread is excellent- a very nice touch. We had the Arancino (rice ball) appetizer, which was very good and doused in an incredibly delicious sauce (the pear shape of the rice ball seemed an unnecessary novelty, but whatever, we were too busy enjoying the taste to care). Next we had the arugula salad, which included juicy tomatoes, creamy goat cheese and crispy prosciutto- again, delicious.  Finally, we had the Bufula pizza. The buffalo mozzarella was lovely but the crust was totally bland and lackluster. If I go back, the crust would stop me from ordering pizza again. Whether I go back is a giant IF because despite a charming atmosphere and a wonderfully rustic menu, the service was awful. The hostess ignored us for at least 3 minutes when we walked in. Finally a friendly waitress approached and asked us if we had a reservation (we didn't, but the place was only half full at best). Our waitress was extremely peppy and personable but rushed us throughout the meal (she took away my app plate without asking while there was still food on it - I would have stopped her but I had a mouthful of food). The rush continued until our meal came to an end, at which point we sat idly waiting for attention for about half an hour. The pacing was all wrong and I found myself eating at high speed to try to scarf down the food before it was taken away. Twice we had to tell the serving staff that no, we were not finished with the food we were clearly still eating. I could understand this (maybe) if folks were waiting for tables, but the restaurant was never even close to full. It didn't help that we were seated in a terrible location where our chairs were constantly bumped by servers, patrons and children running by. I might give it one more chance because the food was quite good but honestly, this is Montclair and there is certainly no shortage of places to eat. It would be a shame for this place to fold because of terrible service.

Make a reservation on the weekends! I looked through the menu and decided on the chicken shish and my boyfriend got the chicken saute. The lady (owner?) told us since all the ingredients are fresh, it would take about 45 minutes for the food to come out. We said no problem. Then she asked if we wanted to order an appetizer in the meantime and we respectfully declined. Clearly she did not like that answer because after that she just picked up our menus and left. She never came out to ask us how our food was, which she was clearly doing for the other tables. She even said goodbye to each group on the way out, and she did not do that for us (even though she was right by the door!). Clearly making a few extra bucks was so important to her. The food itself was really good - fresh and delicious. However because of the unnecessary rude treatment, I will not be returning.

The man who answered the phone was courteous and explained to me in detail as to what I was ordering. My food was ready when I arrived to pick it up. A lady greeted me and asked if I was there for the pick up order. On my way out, she walked me to the door and served me a bowl filled with candy. I grabbed a few and out I went. On to the food. I ordered a simple doner(gyro) platter. It was topped with some tomato sauce, had a side of white rice,brown grain rice, all sitting on top of a bed of potatoes.  It also came with a side of tzatziki and a fresh, hot Turkish bread. The gyro meat was perfectly seasoned, and most importantly, very tender and fresh. Being so used to the NYC street cart gyro,which are low quality frozen mixed meat, you really appreciate the quality of the gyro meat at The Bosphorus. The quantity was enough for two people to share or have the leftovers for lunch the following day. I'm looking forward to the dining experience.

Everyone is super friendly and accommodating. I always feel like they're super excited to see me, and it's nice. I normally order the chicken shish for lunch. They give so much food that I only eat half and save the rest for dinner later. They give a generous portion of the chicken (which is so juicy and very well seasoned) some sort of red grain that's also good, but i'm not sure what it is, and either rice potatoes AND grilled veggies. What! But wait, there's more. They also serve it with a sizable lunch salad and fresh bread that's the size of the takeout platter. I also always ask for extra tzatziki sauce on the side.

We each ordered the build-your-own grilled cheese plus a Mac and cheese to share. You fill out your own order sheet, meaning you check off boxes on a menu to give to your server, who then copies it into the computer. After we handed in our sheets, the server came back to tell us they don't have arugula. Fine, no problem, sometimes you run out of things. However when my sandwich came, it was missing both bacon and the fried egg that I ordered. It also had a dark rotting piece of avocado with the hard little end piece, which I bit into. Mac and cheese was bland and the ""breadcrumbs"" were 5 croutons thrown on top. When I told the waiter that my sandwich wasn't right, he was mildly apologetic but made no attempt to rectify it. This was really disappointing because this neighborhood needs some good sandwich spots. Ugh.

Like I was down to my tank top and almost sweating. They must have put the heat on 90 because it was unbearable. They did turn it down but the fact that I ordered hot food didn't help. The veggie dumplings were very yummy. There are 6 in an order and they are bite sized. The soup was good but it was small and I wish it was spicier. I have had better tom yum soups. The green curry with tofu was AMAZING. I love how they use sliced bamboo shoots to almost feel like noodles. It was spicy and really hot in temperature which is just how I like my food. My dad ordered some shrimp veggie dish that came In some kind of rice paper bowl. It was amazing as well. The only thing that bothered me is that the dishes were extremely small.

Also, the place must be under new management cause the past two (which will also be the last two) times I went, the service was horrid. Not so much the waitress, but the manager or whoever was overseeing things. The food has also taken a downhill turn. The soft, chewy noodles that I used to crave on a daily basis are no longer so. The flavors that used to remind me of the hole in the wall places in Thailand are now no longer so. Flavors taste more Americanized, less spice, much sweeter. Pad See Ew tasted like they put molasses in it. Not only that, but the receipt my friend signed either got misplaced or he signed the wrong copy, needless to say the manager chased him down, yelling. We returned to rectify the situation. The manager wanted to re-swipe his card - we said no and asked her to just reprint the receipt. She finally did after much strife. Because my friend was unimpressed by the food, service during the meal, and the manager's attitude about the receipt, he added a 10% tip. She proceeded to call him out saying ""Don't you live in NY, you HAVE to tip 20%,"" and also arguing and yelling other things (in a tiny restaurant with quite a few people around). It was inappropriate and really embarrassing, mostly for her. Yes, it's NYC, and we rarely tip less than 18%, but a tip is still based on customer service, and you can't treat customers that way and expect your 20%.

Even though it was 20 degrees outside, I spent 10 minutes standing by the edge of the sidewalk snapping a bunch of photos to add to my food adventure media compilation. Was it worth practically freezing my fingers off? Yes, yes it was because when I stepped into their (crowded) shop, I was greeted by their large variety of crepes (oh and wall art that i spent another 5 mins taking pictures of lol)...Hmm so much for my simple definition of a crepe now is it? Their menu has a selection from savory to sweet crepe creations as well as beverages such as coffee, tea and shakes. So far, I've tried (among several visits and stealing bites from my food buddies of course!) the Azuki Berries, Strawberry Banana, Chicken Thai and Crepe Dog. -Azuki Berries--it's like me in a crepe. All my favs wrapped in one: strawberries, matcha green tea ice cream, red bean, whipped cream, matcha custard, chocolate Pocky and almonds. IF YOU'RE A MATCHA GREEN TEA FANATIC LIKE ME GET THIS ONE^^^ -Strawberry Banana: pretty standard crepe; nothing special about it really. It's exactly what the name says it is along with some whipped cream and some almonds. My friend got this with a scoop of green tea ice cream (extra charge 2.50). -Chicken Thai: It had mixed greens, cucumbers, carrots, several slices of chicken, cilantro, some sort of sweet/sour sauce, sesame, and a mild wasabi sauce. The sauce has a very strong sour smell to it (minty gum afterwards indeed) but it def tasted better than it smelled! -Crepe Dog: My daring food buddy got this because of it's unique description--kurobuta sausage, daikon, carrots, corn, cheddar cheese, ichimi toragashi (red pepper flakes), tofu sauce and banana ketchup. He liked it a lot but it was too salty for my liking. This one is def most flavor-packed. The store is really tiny; only has two window seats and a small bench on the side. You can have our orders to go; they place it in a clear plastic bag shaped specifically for the crepe cone--very cute and convenient. I'm leaning more towards their their sweet crepes.

The food was decent, but given how long the wait is on a Friday night (and the accompanying price tag), I was expecting a more memorable, mind-blowing meal. Our table ordered: 1. Steamed Buns - Pretty bland. The ones at Ippudo are way tastier. 2. Buffalo Pork Buns - Much more flavorful than the Steamed Buns. This was one of the better dishes we ordered. 3. Honeycrisp Apple Kimchi - Not bad, but I was content with just one piece of apple kimchi. 4. Fried Brussels Sprouts - This was my favorite dish of the night. However, as a carnivore, I think it  says a lot about the quality of the food when the best dish is brussels sprouts. I know very well that I can make brussels sprouts that are just as good, and that's a HUGE issue for me when I'm shelling out a lot of money to dine at a trendy restaurant. 5. Roasted Jurgielewicz Duck - Decent, but forgettable. 6. Spicy Pork sausage & Rice Cakes - This was not bad, probably my third favorite dish behind the Buffalo Pork Buns and Brussels. But food aside, my BIGGEST issue with this restaurant is how RUDE the HOSTESS was. I came in about two hours before my party was meeting up to put my name down as it was a friday night for a party of 5. A table was surprisingly available 45 min later, but our party was obviously not together and Momofuku's seating policy requires the entire party to be present. I come back two hours later, right before my party arrives, to see how much longer it would be for the next table to be available.  The hostess takes a look around the restaurant, which is at most 40 feet long, to see that there's a table opening up right next to entrance (so her terribly long walk across the restaurant was essentially fruitless). As she points out the table in front of me opening up, I tell her my party is arriving shortly. To which she responds in the bitchiest, most pretentious tone possible: ""I don't mean to be rude, but it kind of wastes my time when you ask me to look around the restaurant for a table when your party isn't here."" 1. I didn't ASK her to look around the restaurant, especially since there was a table right in front of me opening up. Is it that unreasonable for a paying customer who had come two hours earlier, anticipating a busy friday night, to be given an approximate estimate of when I could be seated. 2. Isn't that her fucking job? 3. What precious time was I wasting being that a) she's at work b) I was the ONLY person at the hostess area 4. She has the easiest job out of everyone working at that extremely busy restaurant, so who is she to be the one displaying such rudeness? I apologize for how long-winded that was, but that really left a bad taste...and the mediocre food did not do much to get rid of it.

It was as excellent as we remembered. This time around, having already tried the original Korzo burger, tried the Slav and it was a delight! Beef patty, braised pork neck, caraway seeds and juniper berry, Bryndza cheese and the house kraut all inside the classic fried bun! Halusky and bratwurst went around the table and we all feasted! Service was great and the atmosphere was a bit more homey than the one in Manhattan was- bigger and less cramped, yet much more comfortable. A piano resides in the corner, and while I was tempted to ask if I could play some jazz for a while, alas I was so full I could barely move. Korzo is always a delight, and it is clear they take great pride in their unique craft.

An old girlfriend and I were looking for a nice spot to grab dinner and catch up after not seeing each other for a year. I had saved this spot on Yelp as a place I'd take my boyfriend, but since we were in the area I figured we'd give it a shot. When we walked in, we were greeted by the host (bartender?) and he asked us whether we would like to be seated near the bar, on the ground floor, or upstairs. I heard great things about the balcony seating area so we headed upstairs and were handed off to another waitress to seat us. She gave us many options to sit and we chose to sit outside on the balcony, which was surprising warm even on a cold winter night! There are also seating options inside near the fireplace which was a great touch! Our waitress then promptly gave us menus and asked us for our preferred water (tap, sparkling, and still? There was a third choice but I forgot it). My friend and I skipped out on alcohol tonight because we both were a bit sick, but I'd love to come back to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner again. The drink menu looked like it had good options and I can't wait to come back to try. As for the food, the menu offers such a variety. We decided to start off with the escargot and a fried seafood mix which were both pretty good! They promptly gave us bread and butter right after we ordered our meal and service was great. The waiters were very attentive and came frequently to refill our glasses with water whenever they saw the glass close to empty. I never had any experience eating escargot, but it was nice and garlicky and I enjoyed it. The fried seafood mix was also yummy but next time I'd opt for something different. For our main meal, we ordered the special (pan seared scallops with couscous) and the steak frites. The scallops were a bit salty but it played well with the couscous. The steak was heavenly and it was a great portion. The two of us managed to clear our plates and were definitely full by the time we finished our meal. I had gotten up midway to go to the bathroom and returned to find my napkin neatly folded which was so sweet and charming. By the time we finished our meal, our waitress promptly cleared our tables and handed us the dessert menu. Because we already had something sweet earlier, we decided to skip out but their options sounded yummy as well! Their prices on all menus were very reasonable and I cannot wait to come back again. All in all, a great spot for something intimate, good food, and a good time!

I created a yelp account for the sole purpose of telling you all how awful my experience was at Founding Fathers. Four of us hoped to dine here on New Year's Day, late afternoon. The service was nothing less than atrocious. This was not the fault of our server, a friendly woman who did her best to help us. The source of the problem came from the ""manager"" on duty, who was awful for the job. To start, there was not a hostess in site. We sat ourselves after a 5-10 minute period. The staff consisted of the ""manager,"" two waitresses, and a single bartender. Given that this is a busy day for late lunches and drinks, they were severely understaffed. Everyone else who entered did the same thing, leaving the two waitresses with a packed house to serve. The so-called manager was doing very little to help, and should have been telling people that there would be a wait, rather than letting everyone enter and sit. It took about 20 minutes to get water and menus, and another 10 before we got sodas and ordered food. It was an hour wait before we got our food, and the appetizer we ordered came out last. However, in that time, a group of 6 who knew the manager personally was seated, received 2 rounds of drinks, multiple apps, and their meals. It was disgusting to see him play favorites. Meanwhile, every other table that had arrived prior to them was waiting on food. One table cheered aloud when they got their drinks after a half hour wait. While waiting for our food, we asked if we could have something comped, given the awful service. We almost left before the food arrived, but stayed when we saw the waitress bringing it out. As she got us to-go boxes, she said she would ask the manager about having a pizza taken off of the bill. In addition to not helping her and the other waitress with the abundance of customers, he offered no compensation. Needless to say, I will never be going back here. I will also be telling everyone I know not to attend this place. I'm just glad that I got to deter some people from eating there, as we were sitting right by the entrance, and told them they'd have better luck elsewhere.

It's a really nice space, and like other reviewers have said, there's no bad seat in the house. Only issue is, I feel that there are a few too many tables crammed in the center of the space. If you're in a chair backing an aisle, you will get bumped into, by patrons and servers alike. Place wasn't even close to full, and my friend and I were getting nudged left and right. It's not a huge issue, and can easily be fixed by someone on their staff who's good at chair Tetris, but should definitely be addressed so that the place isn't just deadlocked when it's full. The menu has got all the standard new-American fare we've gotten used to seeing from everywhere else that's opened in the last few years. I got some jerk wings, and they were awesome. Fries were good, too, and are big enough to share, but I kind of had a brain fart when I realized ""man, these were $7."" Didn't really make sense to me, considering the wings, which were huge both individually and in terms of how many you got in a single order, were only something like $11. I guess I really wanted fries. The beer selection is good, and isn't any cheaper or pricier than other craft pubs. The service was friendly, if a bit slow. Little things like having to ask for ketchup with the fries, or extra napkins with the wings, or getting the check. Again, easy fixes. All of this added up to an experience that, though pleasant, could use a few tweaks. Looking forward to coming back for those wings.

549120,83858,4533,2.0,1,2015-01-06,"The food is poor. I'll start there. The three of us went in last week for a game. One doesn't expect Michelin stars at a sports bar, but this is Philadelphia--one of the better restaurant towns in the US. If you live in the city, you've come to expect more. This is about Applebee's level for center city restaurant prices. The pizza is a notch above what you'd buy in the supermarket to heat up at home, and I'm not convinced that it's not exactly that. Salads are sad, wilted things, with strange dressings. The wings are passable, but the gelatinous sauce would get worse by the minute as they cool down. You could always do a few shots before eating, though, which could help. Then the service. There is ""cool sports bar,"" and then there is awkward and cold, which is what I found here. The waitstaff was not well informed on the menu or the drink selection. I'm amazed this place is open until 2am. I hope they stay in business, but they're not of the quality of other local businesses (except maybe the also awkward and not very good ""Miles Table."" It's an up and coming neighborhood, and maybe Founding Fathers will find the constitution to improve (see what I did there?)

Bar was packed and a very tight space (hi-tops were very tightly placed), and was standing room only (football playoffs, but not for Eagles). Much like many other places in Philly (byobs) there wasn't much attempt to deaden the noise, and it was extremely noisy in the place (think double-wide row home, whitewashed walls, 120 people with standing-room-only in a pretty tight space). It might be fine for a random Saturday afternoon sitting at the bar when it's quiet, but I would avoid it otherwise. I'm not a fan of Fox & Hound, but sometimes it does the trick, and at this point I would actually recommend F&H over this place.

549123,247801,4533,1.0,1,2015-01-01,"I went there around 1pm on New Years and it was one of the worst dining experiences of my life. Let's set the stage: It's 1 PM on New Years Day in Philadelphia. People have off work for a holiday, and there's a massive parade happening, bringing even more people into the already bustling city. College bowl games are on, as well as the hockey winter classic. You own a sports bar/restaurant and have 1 bartender and 2 servers on staff. Repeat 1 bar tender, 2 servers. . .no other front of house staff. I'll give the owner benefit of the doubt. Maybe they had a slow lunch hour? Maybe he wanted to be the ""cool"" boss and let some employees go home early and enjoy the holiday. Gutsy call, but I respect you for making it. Problem is, now you have to live with it. We walked in just after a large party was being seated. The stools at the bar were about 80% filled, and there was a table scattered here or there. There was no one up front seating people, so we awkwardly stood there for a couple minutes before we just sat ourselves. As soon as we did, this a rush hit, and more people started coming through the door. This was when I first got a glimpse of the owner/manager Bozo. He dressed out of an L.L. Bean catalog, and had his laptop set up at the bar- common move for the ""big shot"" of a privately owned establishment. Let everyone know you're busy and important, because you have a laptop at a bar. He quickly realized he was in over his head as the crowd at the door started to grow, and more patrons started to seat themselves. His initial reaction was to shift this new responsibility to his wait staff. . . whom he had just sat a large party (see where this is going?). * At this point, had Bozo just walked up front and acted as a host, he could have instantly reduced the stress of the situation by about half. Instead he wandered around aimlessly doing as many simple, one handed, unnecessary tasks as he could to give the appearance that he was doing something helpful: grabbing a menu, moving a salt shaker, pouring a beer. Yes, these tasks may have been saving his staff a second or two here and there, but it wasn't addressing the main issue (controlling the flow of patrons into the restaurant). The next hour or so could only be described as organized chaos, with patrons either seating themselves or just leaving in the confusion. Never once did it strike Bozo to tell people there would be a wait, thus giving his staff a much needed break in the action. Meanwhile every table seated has an empty glass, no food, and hadn't seen their swamped server in a half hour. Sorry I lied, not every table had no food. The one 6-top that walked in after a bunch of us, and chatted in up with Bozo the owner -they got served well before everyone. Maybe someone should have told him his friends aren't the ones that are going to leave him a 1 star review on Yelp. An hour after sitting down we had each consumed 1 soft drink, and never saw a refill. A table next to us got their first round of beers half an hour after ordering them. We wanted to just leave at this point, but were held hostage by the fact that we had actually placed our food order. When it finally came out (not all at once, but sporadic and random) we had it boxed and left. We did not blame this on our waitress. She was a champ. I would have been so visibly distraught had I been forced to work under such ridiculous circumstances caused by such horrible management. . .but she kept a cheerful demeanor the entire time. Very impressed by how well she handled the situation. She tried to get Bozo to comp some of our food, which he fought with her about. We ended up paying full price. The few times Bozo did stop by our table, he just stood there with a sheepish look on his face, like a lost toddler. This review is solely for that poor excuse of a man. Have you ever worked in a restaurant? If you answered 'no' then why are you trying to run one? Having money and watching Food Network does not qualify you to own a restaurant. Everything wrong that happened at your place was straight out of Restaurant Management 101: -You have a host up front, especially on a holiday when people are off work and tend to go out. -You go on a wait if your staff/kitchen gets backed up. -When patrons face unreasonable wait times, and you fail to provide them with adequate service, you comp items on their bill. Whats $20 in food costs if it means they come back one more time and spend $50? I mean c'mon man, this is common sense. Someone that oblivious to how the food service industry works does not deserve to profit off people's hard earned money. The $30 tip we left our waitress for the personal hell she had to go through that day was money well spent. The $68 full priced check we paid I consider money stolen from me by Bozo the owner. Only way I would ever think of going back there is if they tarred and feathered Bozo in the street as small children threw rocks at him.

Our appetizers were decent, we got the shrimp one which was very unique and tasty. The actual main courses were VERY salty. It didn't ruin the flavor, but I definitely noticed it a lot. The staff was also very friendly AT FIRST. We had gone there because I bought the voucher from Amazon Local for Castalia 997. Upon our arrival, our waiter took my voucher number first before we even ordered anything, so that he could verify it. He came back moments later and said good to go, so we proceeded with our meal(thinking he'd checked the validity and we were in the clear). At the end of the meal, he tried running the voucher and ran into some difficulty. Apparently in his little hand written book, someone had already used this voucher number. He came to the table to explain this to us, and both my boyfriend and I insisted that we had never been to this establishment before in our lives. He then questioned if I'd given someone else my Amazon account to use, to which I of course replied no. He also realized that he's the one who had written the voucher number down on the previous occasion, and admitted he didn't remember ever seeing either of us there prior to this evening(this made both my boyfriend and me question whether he'd made a mistake in his book). There was some back and forth, and eventually he said he would call the customer service number that Amazon provided. He made us wait at our table for about 15-20 minutes while he argued on the phone with Amazon, and even put me on the phone with the representative to verify my account with her. Eventually he came back to the table, after my boyfriend had already grown quite upset at the fact that we were sitting waiting in this empty restaurant, well after our meal had ended. He explained that Amazon wasn't helpful to him and that he could not honor the voucher. This made us even more upset, and we asked why. He explained that there was some miscommunication between him and the Amazon representative but that he couldn't figure out how the voucher had already been used, and therefore would be unable to honor it. Prior to this ordeal, the restaurant owner had approached our table to make sure everything was going well (and at that point it was) so my boyfriend asked if he could speak to the owner once the waiter refused to accept our voucher. The owner then declared that we ""bought the voucher from Amazon, not him."" so he would absolutely not honor the voucher. This was very poor customer service in our opinion, all over a measly $20 that the restaurant would potentially be losing out on based on their OWN error. We immediately paid our bill and left without leaving a tip, after receiving horrible customer service. It's no wonder that place is going down the drain. There were literally no other patrons in the restaurant on the night we visited, we should've taken that as a sign.

I came here last Friday along with what appears to be several other diners who also read the feature on Balvanera in the ""Tables for Two"" column in the New Yorker. This Argentinian (Argentine and Argentinian are also supposedly valid words...I had no idea that these were real words) restaurant is located in LES, featured prominently on the corner of Stanton and Suffolk st. I don't even think I can say that I've been to more than five Argentinian restaurants in my life, so I was happy to try out this new place after reading the raving review. The food wasn't a complete miss, but it certainly underwhelmed. Let's start with what my gf and I shared: Sardines Sweetbreads Octopus Bone-in Ribeye Sardines were solid. Sure, it could've been better. But for your everyday serve-in-a-restaurant sardines, these were savory with a pinch of citrus at the end. Paired quite well with the bread provided. The sweetbreads dish was perhaps the highlight of the night. It was a bit...chewier than I liked, but it wrapped up with a nice crispy note at the end and the other ingredients accompanying the sweetbreads were laid out perfectly. Well done on the presentation. The octopus is where this meal began to slacken. The two biggest mistakes you can make while cooking octopus are related to cooking time and cleaning time. Cook it for too little or too long and you've got tough octopus. This is what we had on that particular night. The octopus came out seasoned well enough, but was very difficult to chew. As I'd said, it's paradoxically difficult and easy to mess up octopus cooking. It's a very simple ingredient to work with, but you really have to make sure that you time the cooking just right. In this case the octopus definitely fell flat. The Ribeye was equally unimpressive and I KNOW people won't shut up about South American beef, more specifically Argentinian and Brazilian beef. So I'm expecting some crazy good beef and it came out just meh. I imagine much of the hullabaloo stems from other countries not breeding out the fat in their animals like the US stupidly does, leaving all the juicy flavor instead of siphoning out fat. But I didn't really taste much of that extra flavor in this evening's meal. It was a better steak than usual...but comeon, did I really come to this restaurant for above average steak? I'm torn as to whether I should recommend this restaurant to friends...it's good, but not great, so if you're in the mood for trying out new cuisines and have yet to sample Argentinian fare, I'd give this a shot with your expectations tempered.

They run a $2/plate promo on Tuesdays, and, just as you would expect, they remove the majority of the higher quality plates from the conveyor and populate it with mostly plates that sell for $1.95-$2.95.   I entered the store at 1pm, the room was mostly packed except for a handful of dirty table settings that staff hadn't cleared yet.  The waiting area was overflowing; an unfortunate 13-year old girl kept on getting hit with the door as it was being opened, she had nowhere to go.  They took forever to clear those settings and seat the waiting guests. When I was finally seated, 10 minutes later, it took me twice as long as usual to eat my meal because I had to wait for dishes to be placed on the belt.  At any given moment, only green and yellow plates were available (the aforementioned $2-3 plates) and the parties next to me were also waiting for the other plates, whose empty spots were left unfilled for 10-20 minutes at a time.  The sushi makers, however, were busy making a backup supply of the plates that were already on the belt, and stacking it on the back counter, instead of replenishing the items that were empty. The customer next to me asked a server when a particular plate would be made.  It had been empty for at least 10 minutes.  She was told it would be probably 10 minutes more.  At this point, I interrupted the manager and mentioned it to him; the problem was solved for about 30 seconds.  They made a batch of that roll, and every single plate they put on the conveyor was taken before it reached the end.  The sushi staff, by that time, had gone back to making backups of sushi still on the belt, this time, a yellow plate (shrimp tempura). The manager was playing the role of Hostess, and as a result, was not paying attention to any problems in the restaurant.  He was filling a position that would have been better done by a 16-year old high school girl, where he should have been free to help the sushi staff as they were very, very unable to make wise decisions on their own. The sushi was fresh; it had to be, since by the time they finally made it, the customers took it because it was the only non-$1.95 plates on the belt.  Do they think those people really came there for an avocado roll (rice, seaweed, tiny sliver of avocado inside)?  That's what was 30% of the belt when I left. If they had kept the belt full, I would have been out of there in half the time, making a table available for someone else.  The same went for the neighboring seats.  They lost money in sales probably, because they tried to be cheap with the sushi. Never going back on a Tuesday.

The oxtail and bone marrow-based ramen is an unusual riff on the traditional and is still a very strong bowl of ramen but that is all I can say to recommend it. I would go again if it was convenient but it generally isn't due to the tiny size, the single communal table and the phone line reservations. (For single diners it's probably OK to just drop in.) The one situation I would strongly recommend it over its peers is to take a date who doesn't mind the above dance and isn't looking to linger because there will be other parties waiting to descend on any slowpokes because the atmosphere and the energy does feel much better than most of my experiences at various local ramen shops. For the novelty, if you're a fan of ramen and can afford it, it is definitely worth going through the process and trying Mu Ramen. If you don't eat pork for personal reasons, it might even be a spiritual awakening to a new world. Besides that though, it's unlikely that you'll want to keep it up compared to the various competition in Manhattan which I won't redirect by name because I am curious to see how this business evolves from the pop-up roots.

555980,25310,2836,5.0,1,2015-01-04,"Mu is making me seriously reevaluate my ""Best NYC area ramen list"" and consider breaking it into categories- traditional and ramen with a twist. It's by far the best ramen with a twist and pretty close to being best overall (including my beloved Menya, and Ippudo, Totto). We've had good luck calling as soon as the line opens at 3 pm for reservations.  It only takes about a dozen tries and is worth knowing you have a guaranteed spot before you schlep. Located in the middle of nowhere LIC Queens, look for the blue light on Jackson Ave.  Don't forget to take out cash before you come. We've driven in from NJ each time and parked easily but apparently it's also close to those magical cars underground that cheaply move lots of people around. Once you get in you're gonna wanna Instagram the ramen-like curvy wood planks on the ceiling and the fun terrarium at the center of the long communal table. You won't be alone in doing it so don't feel bad. Recently obtaining a liquor license, Mu has a really solid Japanese beer and sake list. The food menu is sparse and changes nightly based on availability of ingredients. On our recent visits we've tried the dumpling/chicken wings, U&I, and the tonkotsu, Mu, and spicy miso ramens. I can't talk you out of any of them. The chicken wings are some kind of food alchemy- a deboned wing stuffed with foie, bread, and sweet sauce then somehow magically breaded and fried. The result is piping hot, crispy, salty, sweet, and rich bites of heaven. The U&I consists of uni, salmon roe, spicy tuna, wasabi, rice, and seaweed. This is obviously a winner as uni and salmon roe are my favorite raw fish things in the world, and it was SO good I could forgive the spicy tuna, which is usually my least favorite. In this case it was very fresh and lightly dressed. Don't forget to Instagram in front of the terrarium before you dig in, and make sure you get a little bit of everything in one bite. Now onto the ramen- which is always served piping hot with a good ratio in amount and balance of ingredients. The tonkotsu is your traditional silky porky broth, thin, supple noodles, with a twist of dried seaweed which is just noticeable. It really is the perfect amount of food to get a full taste and feel satisfied but not gross. If I was being picky I would like a little more pork but that can easily be obtained. The Mu ramen is also a rich, luscious broth with perfect noodles. The twist here is brisket and pickles reminiscent of a typical NYC deli sandwich. I haven't tried the spicy miso but it passed muster with the mister. We've tried most of the menu that appeals to me (only missed the mussels with a fried rice ball served after to soak up the broth- we actually ordered it last time but they forgot, I won't hold it against them). I would still come back to re-eat and see what else they dream up.

Maybe a little too relaxing as people were taking just about forever eating and chatting (I prefer the hustle and bustle of totto because I like my soup hot over lukewarm but hey, we all have preferences). Oh yeah expect to have friends of the staff to be seated before everyone else too. There were at least two instances of those but I guess it's understandable if I was a worker there too? Appetizers: We ordered the u&i bowl and I have to admit it was really tasty. The uni with the spicy tuna, wasabi, rice and roe just blended so well when eaten together. So yea, at least they've got that going for them. Ramen: My boyfriend ordered the mu ramen (at a whopping $18) and I got the tonkatsu 2.0. The tonkatsu was a LOT better. The tonkatsu broth was good, but not great, and just more flavorful than the mu. The mu ramen just tasted kind of bland. I also don't like the thin ramen they use but again, it's preference, so I won't rate them on that. This meal, altogether, cost about $60. I can't tell you how pissed I was that at this price you get 1) an extremely slow turnover rate 2) forever wait times (at least ippudo or totto are worth it AND you get the loudest and friendliest greeting at the door and when you leave??) and 3) insanely overpriced ramen. I want to say I wanna come back to try the miso ramen but jeezus if they're going to charge $18 for a mediocre ramen, I'll drive to the city for something better. Edit: I enjoyed the shoutout on Instagram. Hey mu!

556190,130464,4685,2.0,1,2015-01-01,"Let me preface this review by saying that this rating is solely based on service, not the food. The food here is good. It's something different and when you're in the mood for something meaty or cheesy, this is your place. However, the service is terrible. I'm really disappointed because el camino is such a great little place in a great location. I wish management would address the service issue and it would be one thing if it was every now and then but after reading other customer reviews on yelp, it's evidently an ongoing problem. We came in for lunch today and it was busy, understandable since it's New Years Day. We put in our name and waited for about 30 minutes, no big deal. Once we were seated, we waited about 10 minutes before anyone approached us. Once the gal who we thought was our waitress brought us water, we started ordering drinks. She let us know that she wasn't our waitress and our actual waitress was bar tending right now also, but she will be over soon. I ordered a coke and she said she'd bring it over, and she did. 20 minutes later, our waitress, or bartender, or whoever, came over and we were already ticked off. 30 minutes until the waitress even comes to the table? The food was good but the waitress was bar tending the whole time. We asked for water a few times from other servers. Once we were done with lunch, we had to ask another waiter for boxes and a different waitress for the check. We waited another 20 minutes for the check to come. After leaving a small tip to reflect this horrible service (almost 2 hours since we sat down now), she comes back to the table to ask if we were really leaving her this tip after she was ""running around"". I really want to keep giving this place a chance but there are just too many good places in the neighborhood for el camino's service to be so bad. I really don't appreciate her calling us out in front of other customers either. Tipping is a reflection of service and it drives me nuts when servers expect a tip even if the service was poor. It's not ok.

Definitely recommend that. However, the service was pretty bad. Our original waitress got halfway through taking our drink order, then walked away to get my coffee but never came back. When we flagged her down she seemed really annoyed and gave our table over to another server. Nobody refilled our coffee without asking, nobody refilled the water until the very end of the meal, and nobody asked how the meal was or if we needed anything. I'd say it was because it was new years day and they were busy but it really wasn't that crowded. Disappointing, because I've been there before and it was better and the food is good, but there's just too many good places in the city to want to go back to a place that doesn't seem to value good service.

I've bought over 5 platters just to bring some home for leftovers and maybe friends (if i don't gobble it all up myself)! You cannot beat it. Don't be afraid of the line--it moves more quickly than you think! These guys have it down to a science. The SW corner (across from the Hilton ice bar) is only open late night but the SE corner (across from the MoMA) is open earlier! Both are indescribably delicious. The gyro is a bit greasy (in the best way possible) but packed with flavor and moisture. Chicken is more subtle in flavoring but rounds out everything nicely in the mix. Even the lettuce is good! I don't know what about half-steamy lettuce amongst rice, meat, and plushy pita is so delectable but everything is just perfect! Huge portions--I don't think I've ever finished a whole one. Great for the price, which they recently raised to $7 versus $6. I would pay $10 for heaven over rice. The white sauce is perfection. Mild and cooling to the fiery volcano red sauce (be careful newbies!! this sauce has got BITE) but so flavorful too! The fire sauce is great, but you only need so much. Hot but packed with delicious flavor! And not to mayonaise-y tasting. They give them out in packets now (2 white and one red per platter) but they also have the bottles around the side! The only problem is they don't deliver over the Hudson! If you're in New York, do yourself a flavor and get your Halal fix here and here only!

Upon having them all together at once, it was just like a match made in heaven. There is a reason why Halal guys have consistently been placed as one of New York City's top street food. Initially I was very much speculative and skeptical just like any other person about Halal Guys. But upon tasting it, I can safely say I agree with the rave reviews given. Last but not least, it is of paramount importance to note that with great cheap food, there have to be something that is lacking, perhaps in the service efficiency. However none of it was experienced during the times I purchased food from the Halal guys. In fact, they are probably one of the food carts with an excellent service and greater efficiency compared to their peers. All in all. 5 out of 5. Well deserved hype.

With so many good things being said about the establishment, I had imagined such a wonderful place in my mind, and could not wait to get a taste. Finally, my friends and I had arrived at the spot...In the middle of a business area with no restaurants anywhere in sight. Confused I was, looking around for any store sign that had ""Halal"" in its name. My friend then grabbed me and pointed to a small, janky little food cart located outside of a huge business building... ""We came all the way here for a dinky little food cart?"" I thought to myself. Nevertheless, I remained optimistic about the food and proceeded to order. My friend ordered what I think was the beef bowl dish thing. It came with orange rice, beef, and a little bit of lettuce. Nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently, the key was to put their signature sauces on the food: the yogurt, and the HOT sauce (HOT in caps because it was really freakin hot). With all the sauces combined the dish ended up being quite delicious. Although, I'm positive that I've had something similar, if not the same, or better, in OC. There is honestly NOTHING special about this place. its the same old rice and meat you can get anywhere, at any place that sells halal. What's even worse is that you have to go out of the way to some tiny little cart with a long wait, only to eat your food outside in the cold with virtually nowhere to sit and enjoy your meal. The only thing IMO that differentiates the Halal Guys from other places, is their spicy sauce because its significantly hotter than at most other places. But then again, anybody can make a really hot sauce and call themselves amazing too! It's not that hard, people! 3 stars because the food wasn't bad, pretty good, but I definitely don't think this place deserves any superb title, or lots of stars for that matter; they simply don't have that WOW factor.

Hot enough for a good kick but not overbearing. Now my friend got the vindaloo which they warned is very very spicy and I must say, it is.

The wrap was slightly on the colder side because my friends and I opted for take-out (so I'm sure this would have been avoided if we had eaten in-store). I didn't LOVE the way the chicken was cooked-- I'm rather picky though-- but the mint and yogurt sauce coupled with the feta cheese really hit the spot.

If you are eating in or taking out, I like that they offer complimentary tea while you wait. The owner is very nice as well, and always makes sure you're satisfied with the food. Speaking of food, it has hands-down become my favorite Chinese restaurant. I usually order either the vegan sesame, General Tso, or orange ""chicken"". I especially love that they offer meat alternatives other than tofu! Their food is so good that I drove from my home in Vernon to pick some up! There is minimal parking and seating, however I don't usually eat-in so it doesn't bother me at all.

They have a huge vegetarian menu, which is great for me as a vegetarian. They even have several vegan and gluten free options. Way more than I've seen elsewhere. The first time I went was with a group of three friends - two of which are vegan. We ordered the vegan drumsticks, fried vegan mcchicken nuggets, General Tso's vegan chicken, and the vegan orange chicken. All great. We sampled each others plates and no one was disappointed. The vegan chicken is pretty much the same no matter which dish you choose; only the sauce changes. It doesn't quite taste like the real deal, but it still tastes great. Not greasy at all like most Chinese restaurants I've encountered. One of my friends was eating pretty slowly (who ordered the mcchicken nuggets) and was eating more of the vegan General Tso's than her own food. The super friendly owner noticed and offered to put the general tso's sauce on her meal, to which she happily accepted. The only negative I can think of is that the seating is definitely limited, but most order takeout so it usually isn't hard to find a seat.

The vegetarian menu is pretty great -- something like 20 items. I had the General Tso's Tofu, which for me, was the perfect combination of sweet and spicy. My partner had some tofu veggie thing with garlic sauce. I basically got one bite of that, blinked, and saw he finished the entire plate without offering me a second taste. There wasn't a lot of seating, but we had no trouble getting a table around 9 on a Friday night. It wasn't dead -- just mostly takeout. It's conveniently on the Farmington bus line. Parking is a snap (use side streets if lot is full). A little bit less than perfection: serving on throwaway plates. I just really hate wastefulness. The other thing -- it's just one small room with a lot of takeout traffic, which means the door opening a lot. A bit cold this time of year, so next time, I'd just wear another layer.

The experience of dinning at Nan Zhou has gone down since.  I loved the cramped hustle and bustle of the old place.  Gave you the feeling of really dinning in a hole in the wall of Chinatown like I've found a secret niche no one else knew of.  Loved being able to see the chefs pulling the noodles through the window without having to try.   Now the place just seems like a tourist trap.  Just big and empty with decor that doesn't really make sense.  Really we are in Philly can't you put photos of Philly up instead of random cities?  Also I don't appreciate that they increased the prices of their menu.  You are already a cash only place.  The homie vibe that this place used to give is gone.  :( I still go because the food is good but it just doesn't take as good as when it was a 5 dollar bowl of noodles.

I had it about a month or two ago, still the same beef broth.. inflation might have increased the price to about $6.95/bowl of soup. But same is good here -- no better no worse.. just consistent. I recently stopped eating beef and was immensely sad on how many delicious foods I will be missing out on now. I decided to go in and try their chicken noodle soup to see if it was just as good. And I can't say it's just as good. It's good, not great.. but good. The broth is still stellar, flavorful, pickled veggies and that's all still the same. The chicken however is so insanely bland. I'm surprised they don't marinate it in salt/pepper or hot sauce.. or something! they literally just cooked that chicken and threw it in the soup. But glad to see there are other options.

So while I've had amazing ramen and soon do boo, this was certainly different, and altogether delightful. The place was busy, as was expected given the lunch hour + aforementioned dreary wintery weather.  A party of 5 (1 child, 1 infant) was seated rather promptly, as turnover was rapid. I ordered the beef brisket hand drawn noodle based on the recommendation from my sister, a native Philadelphian.  The broth was savory, I could just taste the marrow from the animal from which this brisket came. Now I'm not a fan of chewy tendon in my soup, but I guess that just speaks to the validity of the brisket, not some pre-packaged, mass produced animal, but lots of pieces of the animal gave the flavor.   The noodles were the star here though, as the had the perfect texture, chewyness, length...just everything. Maybe I just bought into the hype, given the name of the restaurant contains the words ""Hand Drawn Noodle House,"" but it did lived up to its billing. My sister and wife both had the duck, which they were raving about. I usually try, but my face was buried in brisket broth. Next time... We also had steamed dumplings, which were cooked well and didn't fall apart. But the sauce that came with it was pretty outstanding.  We also ordered Hot Taro Bubble Tea, which was a winner and kept us warm as we re-encountered the storm on the way out. Can't wait to come back and try the other selections!

Like, what happened to it? Did they serve it to someone else? Eat it themselves? Also, they boxed all of my food together, so that the salad, chicken, and rice was 1 big mess in 1 box, when the night before they had all been served separately. SUPER SLOPPY. I spoke to the manager and he agreed to refund 1/2 of the price of my meal, which is the bare-bones minimum of what I would expect them to do.

Each pizza is personal, but comes in four large slices. So if four people come you can try four different pizzas without wanting to slap eachother for taking an extra slice. I tried the brussel sprouts pizza and really loved it. The speck and taleggio cheese were the right amount of salty with the bitterness of the brussel sprouts. The crust was also amazing, really crisp and had that fire oven taste. My other friends got the sausage pizza, the lamb specialty pizza, and the classic margherita. I found all to be reallyyyy tasty (especially the sausage, the sauce and the flavor of the sausage together was amazing!!) The lamb one was a bit heavy for my taste considering it had ricotta cheese on it (may be wrong, but I thinkkkk it was ricotta). But one slice was really amazing. Another bonus, it's a BYOB! Gotta love that. Overall, this place is tasty, afforable, and I'm definitely coming back

574360,255618,4765,4.0,1,2015-01-06,"I finally got to try Lilley's out for the first time today,  something I have been meaning to do for awhile now based on a recommendation from a friend of mine who swears by their whiting fish. (He swears by it, like it's even better then caviar or filet mingon itself! I did not actually order the whiting fish, but instead opted to get collard greens, and fried chicken with a side of cabbage - all of which were great. However, the macaroni and cheese was less then impressive. In fact, I ended up discarding most of it. It really was not as moist as it should have been and it looked like some of it had been scraped of the bottom of the pan because it was kind of burned. Not that actual golden crisp finish to it, but actually burned. The large corn bread that came with my meal was pretty good, so I will also mention that. The other thing I did not really like was its size. Small and cozy is one thing, but it is just a little bit to small for my comfort, and it kind of felt downright clausterophobic. All the seating areas and booths are crammed together and the rest area probably should be set a little farther back, away from the dining area which is what most people like me really do expect in a restauraunt. The service was good for the most part. The server was polite and took my order quickly, which definitely helped seeing as how I hadn't eaten all day except for a bagle for breakfast and was absolutely starved by the time I finally stopped for lunch. So that part of the dining experience was good and also worth mentioning. This place does have potential but they really need to focus more on the actual quality of their food, not just the quantity. (They do have a good selection of all different types of food however) They might not be able to expand the size of their restauraunt space just yet, depending on maybe what their finances might be at the moment. That is understood and certainly taken into consideration. But I do think they should and could focus on making sure their food is made in a way that would make people want to come back there again. I probably would return and give them a second try in the future. For now I would settle on giving them 4 stars, although maybe a 3.5 rating would probably be more well deserved.

Beurre blanc! Come on, this is offensive to your customers. It's lazy and cheap. Figure out something other than butter. It's not the 80s anymore! They took away a lot of good dishes they used to have like the pork chop and now instead they inexplicably offer five $20 beef burgers with 8 different types of fries which are mostly the same fries just called different things. So confusing and redundant. The roast chicken dish used to be succulent and delicious and now it's anemic with mostly bones and some old-tasting bone-dry meat. It looked like it was randomly hacked apart with a chainsaw, and my dark meat had a weird flap of skin and bone hanging off it haphazardly. Disgusting. Nothing seems fresh here anymore, just cheap ingredients doused with a weird butter sauce. I tried to give the new food a chance. I actually like change and don't mind paying for good food.

Overall, dinner was very nice but we left unhappy and a little underwhelmed with the size of each course. We have dined at other restaurants with similar price points and felt extremely satisfied with our meals... this one left us wanting more (both a curse and a blessing I guess!) We added oysters and each had two drinks. In total, our bill was $150/pp. Each course was 3 or 4 bites, which is very very small. Even the entrée which was a lamb medallion, was given to us with 1  1/2 medallions... literally cut in half. For each of us. Like they couldn't give you two whole medallions? Did they run out of entrees that each diner was allotted only 1  1/2 medallions, each only being 2'' in diameter? (See pictures of Kwazi H.'s crusted lamb below - 1 1/2 medallions) It was bizarre and we left feeling a little empty haha!  The service was wonderful, our waitress was excellent and very friendly.

We had a fantastic five course menu with wine paring, which I think is one of those things that you miss when going to a BYOB. Everything went very well together. My favourite dishes were the Kampachi Crudo (delicious house made buttermilk, pickled radish to give a crisp, tangy taste), sausage crusted lamb with sprouted grain salad (absolutely flawless, house sprouted grains, very surprising). Last but not least. The Chef, George Sabatino, what a cool dude, kinda reminded me of Chef Martin Hamann. It's always great meeting a chef who doesn't think he's God's gift to cooking.

Smoked scallop was perfection, and the garnishes (fennel cracker? YES PLEASE) were creative and well executed. The carrot cake???  Delicious!

Entire menu looks interesting and every item is just a bit different.  We started off with a pickle (house made) and fried cauliflower.  Pickle was good, crispy cucumber taste with a bit of vinegar), a good start.  Cauliflower was very interesting.  Not breaded but flash fried with some fish sauce and hot peppers.  Really different and good. I had the Mr. Rorris; open faced turkey with fries and gravy.  Very nice turkey and fries and gravy.  Reminded me of Nectors (actually not as I can't quite remember what Nector's tasted like at 2:00 in the morning after a night of drinking 20 plus years ago, but as good as I think I remember it).  At $14 I'm sure mr. Rorris is wishing he thought of that price.  I'd order this again. Wife had the burger (we actually split both).  A nice jucy burger with lots of cheese pouring out the sides and the pickles we got to know earlier, diced on top. All in all, a delightful dining experience.  Both staff and food were top notch.  However, on the way out we thought whether we would return and felt there were too many restaurants that were more in our favor and style.  We would visit or revisit those places before we would most likely get the chance to return.  Thats the only reason I'm giving it 3 Stars and not more.  In my mind its ""A-OK"" and I'd go again if I was in the area but would not go out of my way.

I have gotten their clam chowder once before though off their regular menu, and that was fine! $5 fishbowls are very weak, and taste like juice...which is fine but it is more of a powdered juice. Their happy hour drinks are also very meh-- I feel like their house wine is boxed...

As in the party room had not a single open chair left in it late. But alas, the staff showed me to an open, and quite comfortable tall chair downstairs and made my two hour crash at the bar exactly everything I didn't know I wanted. They booked my hotel with a sweet discount down the street (poof, just wished me a reservation, might be witch craft..might be connections) they brought me whatever they were eating upstairs, and rummaged the kitchen for the tiramisu desert they were out of. I failed to eat an oyster, but the tiramisu stuff at the end of my meal was excellent. I had chicken on top of rice and asparagus..some concoction that was on the interview menu. It was the kind of rice you think about later. The beer selection was nothing special. The first three things I asked for were cashed. Do people really drink cider? Regardless the bar has a unique feels to it. I would sit there again. The dining areas were inviting. I liked this place. The staff made the experience worth tapping out this review.

582253,202685,4824,5.0,1,2015-01-05,"BEST EMPANADAS IN QUEENS I've had my fair share of empanadas so I thought I knew what I was doing. Little did I know, I was very very wrong. This place taught me how an empanada should taste. Your first bite should be filled with the PERFECT proportion of delicious meat & shell. Before this, I was taking three bites of the corn breading before getting to any meat (I might take tiny bites, but still, you get the point). This place was love at first bite! I love that this place makes their empanadas fresh. It's slightly pricier than your average empanada spot, but totally worth it! Completely worth your extra fifteen cents or so because your empanada is completely filled and with just the right amount of breading (super thin compared to other spots). They use quality ingredients and you can taste the difference. I always get the shredded beef with potatoes and ground beef with cheese. The spinach & ricotta is also really good. I've tried the chicken ones too. You pretty much can't go wrong. I prefer the corn flour over the organic. If you happen to stop by, don't forget to try the homemade ice pops! They're really tasty! Despite the fact that this place is a pretty far from me & never has anywhere to park, it's still worth the trip!

The restaurant is a bit pricey with entrees ranging from $25-$30, and appetizers from $10-$20. For that price, I definitely do NOT think the quality of food and relatively unimpressive ambience is worth it. Everything we ate was ok-- fried calamari, filet mignon and hangar steak. The meat was DRENCHED with sauce, which to me indicates a lower quality product. The filet was delicious, and if it had been about $15, I would not have had a complaint. But, for $30, it seemed like a rip off. The ambiance, as I mentioned, is not one of a pricey restaurant, but more like a lower end chinese or thai restaurant. I also definitely did not get a vibe in either the ambiance or food of anything African or Mediterranean. The service was fabulous, and everyone was incredibly friendly, attentive, and great. Again, I am not saying don't go to Ponty Bistro. What I want this review to indicate is that the food is priced WAY too high for the quality of the overall experience.

I'm not talking like, been in a busy restaurant and have some stains, we're talking like gross dirty shirt, stained and marked on tie. Second, we ordered crab cake eggs Benedict. Terrible decision. They tasted fishy and gross. Avoid at all costs. Third, this might have been able to be remedied had the waiter come back to the table, I don't know, ever, after we sat down and asked how everything was. I would have kindly replied, ""not good,"" and maybe we could have worked out another suitable plan to get satisfactory breakfast.  However, that did not happen. So when we were finally desperate to leave at the end, had clearly not eaten most of our food, we flagged him over and asked for the check.  He came over, saw that we hadn't eaten much, but didn't say a word, just handed us the check and walked away. Ugh. All of us felt gross and frustrated as we left. It was a miserable experience.

I had steak tartare this time, which was nice and flavourful with the horseradish giving it a nice spicy kick. It's a little pricy, as evidenced by the six asparaguses we got as a side dish, which cost .. six dollars. One negative aspect is its layout.

The portion sizes along with the bread basket will have you going over your max limit if you're not careful. Service is friendly and excellent. If you're a table of two, expect limited mobility where your elbows are concerned. You get packed in. Totally recommend this place for Italian food while in NYC. Thank you Yelpers.

Ciccio is the restaurant I have taken my friends and family to when they visit me in NYC. The pictures of the interior/ambiance/atmosphere that I found on Yelp for Ciccio is what drew me to this restaurant. I personally love very small, close-knit, and dimly lit locations. For some reason it just gives it the New York City vibe that I am looking for and love. I like that it goes downstairs too as soon as you enter. On top of how much I love the atmosphere, the food is SO DELICIOUS. My absolute favorite (which I will get every time) is the Pappardelle Verdi Con Salsiccia, Cavolo Rosso E Crema Di Gorgonzola. It's an amazing sausage pasta. I also recommend getting out of your comfort zone from beer/wine and trying one of their cocktails! I can't remember the exact name of the one that I always order, but it had lemon, celery, and a drop of olive oil (yes it sounds weird.. But so worth it).

The restaurant has a beautiful rustic design and is unpretentious. Three delicious breads were brought out by our awesome waiter and devoured quickly by my awesome colleagues.

I ordered the Parma pizza. It was great but basic with arugula and prosciutto. I wish I had been more ambitious and gone for the Lombarda pizza but there's always next time.

The interior was nice, although a bit dark which made it seem closed.  The staff seemed genuinely uninterested and unfriendly. The food was okay - nothing to rave about and nothing to come back for, but mildly stomachable. I would say the dessert was the standout course in my opinion and the only thing that was truly delicious was the Mexican Cappucino. It is extremely overpriced in my opinion and I know this is due to the area, but the portions could have been bigger and the flavors better, especially for a place selling itself as a fusion restauraunt when I felt that they were basically selling separate menus of French and Mexican cuisine. All in all, great idea, just not executed well. Perhaps the whole experience would've been better if we felt more welcomed, but everything else was pretty lacklustre.

It can be a little noisy in Jolie Cantina, but I found the music volume to fluctuate.  When they music wasn't loud enough so that I couldn't speak to my friends, I was a little ticked (maybe because I was also hungover?), but then - miraculously - the volume was turned down and I could hear again!  Another diner must've said something, for which I am grateful. I highly recommend Jolie Cantina for brunch since that's the only meal I've dined there for, but considering how much everyone loved their meal, and not only 'brunchy' items were ordered, I'd also recommend for dinner.

589094,41905,4881,5.0,1,2015-01-03,"To quote the legendary ad - ""I can't believe I ate the whole thing."" Following Nadia Z's glowing review, my newly-designated fiancée and I (we got engaged NYE, forgive me if I mention her a little too often this time) came in here for brunch. We were particular about our selection - it needed mimosas, and it needed smoked salmon benedict. Anella absolutely delivered! First of all, the place is absolutely charming. The decor is run-down-on-purpose, giving it a cozy, relaxed feeling. Everyone we encountered was very polite, no complaints there! Their brunch menu is a perfect size - enough options to stay interesting for a few more trips, but not so large as to be dizzying. For my part, I tried the blueberry brioche french toast, and the fiancée had the smoked salmon benedict - we also ordered the mysterious pastry basket, which came first. The contents apparently rotate by the day, but the warm donut holes are not to be missed! That said, it's definitely to be split, because the basket + an entree would probably make any single diner explode. The portions are generous. Which is a gentle way of saying that they're ridiculously large, but my french toast was so tasty it was well worth the ensuing stomachache I got from stuffing my face. It's a very sweet french toast, so it suits me fine, but might not be to everyone's taste. Make sure to spread the cream around - it's absolutely vital to the dish! The candied pecans were also a nice touch, even though I'm not really a pecan man. The smoked salmon benedict got two thumbs up, and my girl knows her brunch salmons. She said it was fresh and tasty, though far too much to finish - I helped her on the home fries that came with it, which were also very good. Mind, you get what you pay for. While not exorbitant, it's easy to order more than you can manage, and you may end up with a check to match. Expect large portions though, and you'll do just fine.

I also ordered the botanica cocktail from my table - a bit more sour with a refreshing basil taste, even more yum. There were three of us and we split the spinach salad, four cheese pepperoni pizza and the cherry stone clam pizza. The clam pizza is much more enjoyable when it's hot and it's not overpowering with flavor, but it's absolutely delightful. However, that pepperoni pizza is out of this world!! The cheeses include an odd variety like gorgonzola. Hands down, the best pizza on the menu. The salad was also fresh, but I'm sorry, I'm never one to rave about salad. Oh, and we also got the tiramisu with a scoop of dark chocolate gelato - amazing, fluffy goodness! This spread was just enough for the three of us. Also note that the pizza crust is pretty thin, but still bubbly, which makes for the perfect oven fried pizza. The ONLY downside to this place is that the service is a bit slow. I think it's because of the product. A pizza just doesn't take five minutes to bake! But even our spinach salad came out a tad slow.

Watch them being made in the window near the back as they prepare the dough and then roll it out thin and stuff them with a pork mixture and then deftly seal them.  This last visit I was surprised to see on their specials board something they called chicken casserole?! It was actually what I have known as chicken whiskey soup; however I don't think they added the whiskey but it had all the other ingredients...lily buds, wood ears, meaty chicken legs, ginger and a great tasting broth. It should be on their main menu. This is also a confinement soup (what new mothers eat during their first month after giving birth) and since it was a chilly day, the soup was very comforting. The wait staff is very helpful so be sure to have them explain any dishes that you might not be familiar with. I have found that they sometimes name their dishes something that is not very explanatory!

Just make sure you get the Rosa's Eggplant Rollatini and not the regular one. Again, the meal comes with a nice side of your choice of pasta along with the standard Italian bread, garlic knots, and wine too. The calamari appetizer with the fra diavolo sauce was delectable as usual. The guys work hard here and the quality of the food demonstrates this commitment. The decor is a bit dated, but this place is the best Italian joint I've found in the southern CT area.   If you're hesitant to try the place, they have a bunch of coupons that give really good deals.

However, it may not have been the best choice for date night because 1) it is super LOUD. I'm not sure I would have been able to hear my boyfriend even if he were sitting right next to me. You hear your neighbor's business, and your neighbor's neighbor's business, and basically the entire place seats about 50 people and I could hear all of them. 2) Service is very friendly, sometimes to the extent of sitting down next to regulars and chatting. While this certainly shows they have good relationships, I caught the owner trying to get the attention of the sitting waitstaff a couple of times, and I wouldn't have wanted the waiter making my night more awkward if I didn't know my date already. When we were waiting to get seated, the owner just kind of flapped dismissively towards a table and then was just chatting with customers in the entry way, making it hard for anybody to get in or not. Food: Ohhh the moussaka. Come for the moussaka. People apparently do from all over. It is just amazingness in your mouth. Fried artichokes - these were not what I expected, but they were even better. I even at the one that fell on the table. Holy cow the short rib (no pun intended) - we made a game time decision to order this as well, and I am so glad we did. It was rich without being cloying and fell apart to the touch. I did find a piece of paper, oddly, in my mashed potatoes, and didn't get much more than a ""whoops"" apology, and we didn't get offered dessert. (Un)fortunately, this worked out because by that point, we just wanted to get out of the tin noise box. Come for the food but don't expect any intelligible conversation.

Good reviews, excellent photos and decent prices brought me in, and I couldn't have been happier with my choice. Thank you again, Yelp, for steering me to such a great find in the city of brotherly love. Mood Café had some seriously high reviews.. a solid 5 star rating with close to 250 reviews, so they've got to be doing something right. They serve a dish called Chaat here.. something I've never heard of and something that I figured I might as well try. This place is much smaller than I expected. No real sitting area, but they have a couple of makeshift tables and plastic stools for people who want to eat there. Plastic forks, knives and napkins sit by the door as a ""grab your own"" kind of thing. You place your order at the counter and they prepare it in plastic to go containers. Having no clue what I wanted, I told the guy behind the counter that I was in town for the night, saw they had some great reviews on Yelp, and I wanted to see what it was all about. He explained one of the menus was yogurt based smoothies and the other was the chaat. He also helped steer me by asking if I wanted vegetarian or the type of protein I wanted. I think I should point out that I had no clue what chaat was and really still don't. I know it has a lot of tasty sauces.. some crunchy bits and fresh mango in it. Mine had the Chicken Tikka in it too, because that's what I ordered. There were some items in my dish that were cold and some that were hot. Some bits were crunchy and some bits were not. While I cannot tell you exactly what it was (or if it was authentic like some reviews claim it is not) I can tell you it was delicious and I ate every bite of it. I also ordered the blueberry lassi and was really happy with it. A friend ordered the mango and we were each given a full glass of what we ordered and a smaller cup with the other one so we could taste it. I thought this was a really nice gesture and was very appreciative of it. I'd love to tell all of my friends about Mood Café and haul them all to Philly to give it a try, but there wouldn't be enough room in the place for everyone. Instead, I can only share my experience and hope it steers you inside on some cold and rainy night as it did me.

They were open until 10 on a Friday night and I was not sure I would be able to make it there by that time as I had ordered a little after 9:30 and was coming from a few towns away.  I checked and they seemed completely happy with me coming a bit after 10 and they were super nice about it!  While the other location is very comfortable and cozy,  this one definitely strives to be the nicer of the two.  Two water fountains are on each side as you walk in through the entrance to the decorated dining room with lighting to match.  Being used to the perfectly fine but simple decor of the other location, I was surprised. I ordered the chicken madras and bhindi do pyaaza - two dishes we'd had before at Utsav Vernon.  We also got garlic naan.  All very good!  The heat level of the madras was terrific and balance of flavors was achieved very well (my boyfriend who cooks for a living stated, ""They know what they're doing here.  They're not a bunch of children throwing spices around."")  They also packed a complimentary dessert for us to enjoy.

The Details: this  spot has only been  open eight months and therefore does not have the usual loyal brunch crew. We walked in with no reservation and got a great table in the heated outside garden. The table was a little sticky but once I got over that I absolutely love the atmosphere. It was cozy and rustic yet charming at the same time-- a definite date spot or great place to go for brunch with the girls. My eggs Benedict was out of this world, with just the right amount hollandaise. My boyfriend however got the toast with the pulled pork and poached egg which was quite a disappointment. Don't get me wrong, he said it was very tasty however it was one piece of bread served on a side-plate that was not enough for an entrée. There was not even a side salad- it was a confusing dish. This did not by any means ruin our experience, I would just not recommend ordering that for an entrée unless you are not hungry. The Damage: no one ordered drinks so it was extremely inexpensive with 20% tip we each paid $18. Moral of the Story: I will absolutely be returning and plan to try  happy hour--  everyday 4-7 even weekends!

Negative, its cash only.  My meal was decent. I had the steak and cheese sandwich with the sweet potato fries.  I liked the fries but found it odd that they served this sandwich on a round bun and half the meat fell out as soon as you picked it up.

I immediately noticed the odd choice of music they had (it went from opera to Rihanna) and the eery red lighting in the bar area. I had to look around for a sign twice just to make sure I stepped into the right restaurant but rest assured, look up from the entrance and you'll see their burger logo glowing. After a 15 minute wait, we were seated and met our waiter for the night who was gave us one of the most friendly services we ever had (props to Robert!). My friend ordered the Truffle Especiale ($13)--the one served with a sunny side egg and I had the Manly Burger ($13) because I had to have bacon with my burger. We also had their sweet potato fries as sides which were amazing! We waited a while for our food to come so be prepared to wait if you're super hungry! Unfortunately I was quite disappointed about the burger especially since it's what Umami specializes in. We got our burgers before our fries and I noticed that my top bun was hard and not warm. I ended up just leaving out the top bun altogether. I ordered medium rare but I received a very rare burger. burger fell apart very easily so I had to resort to using my fork and knife to finish my meal :( I gave Umami an extra star because the fries were just THAT amazing. No I'm serious, get the sweet potato fries. They were served fresh, crispy, cut perfectly, and coated in cinnamon. (I've had their truffle fries before--too salty for my liking) Honestly I WOULD return to Umami again but not for their burgers but for the fries. I would be satisfied enough if my meal was just their sweet potato fries...and because they offer free wifi (psw is ""cheesytots!"").

Like they gave me a pastrami on just bread.  Like really?  You just give me meat and bread?  I felt like the Miz from wwe monday night raw. REALLY? REALLY? If i just wanted meat and  bread i would have went to the meat packing district and then stopped at papi's corner store for bread.  Not to mention, the mozzarella sticks were like rubber and the marinara sauce was very blan.  Are you serious.  How does marinara sauce get blan?  Someone please tell me how the h3ll white castle's mozzarella sticks are great but the diner gives you rubber mozzarella sticks?  Am i a dog or something?   Honestly anyone that gives this diner 5 stars or thinks this is a great diner.  Then there is def something wrong with you and your taste buds because a person that is dirty and accepts very low quality food would never know what great food tastes like.  Everything about this diner sucks.  They did all this major renovation but the food does not even compliment the renovation.  They can put an outdoor patio for consumers to eat but it still  does not take away the fact that this diner sucks.   I dare someone to ask me would i like to have lunch with them, their treat at the nevada diner.  My answer will be h3ll no.  I wouldn't even recommend this diner to a homeless man if i gave him $20 to have a meal.

There were a number of specials available including a gnocchi and a short rib that I'm still thinking about and salivating.The only dish that stuck out as less than brilliant was the Cassoulet. It was still very good but in comparison to all of the other dishes sampled, it was just that - ""very good"". Interesting (read: good) beer selection and my friends enjoyed their wine as well. The restaurant has very cute light fixtures that reflect trendy yet cozy light patterns on the ceiling and they have my favorite Mrs. Meyers Geranium hand soap in the restroom.

Let me start off with reservations and seating. Reservations were made at least 2 weeks ahead of time for a rather large party (around 20 people) for a surprise birthday party. Upon arrival they told us to sit and wait until our entire party was here. Understandable. Standard protocol for any restaurant. 10 minutes of waiting, 18/20 people in our group were here. Still had to wait. We waited until 20/20 people were here (including the birthday girl herself) and ended up having to surprise her in an unconventional way in front of the door. When we were finally seated after the long wait we were placed in the worst seating arrangement ever. One long strip of about 10 tables connected together. One side was against the wall, the other side had chairs. Okay first off, this is a fire hazard. Secondly, people sitting in the middle of the inside are not able to use the restrooms without disturbing the entire table. Thirdly, the side with the chairs have got to be the worst chairs I have ever sat on. It felt like I was sitting on wires. Leaning back on the chair felt like you were about to fall off. Waiters were doing a good job taking orders and delivering food until one of them clumsy knocks one of the plates over one of my friends head and nearly spills the plate. I understand accidents happen but there was already way too many mistakes happening and we didn't even get our food yet.   Food was ALRIGHT. Honestly you can almost never go wrong with any Thai Foods. Portions are way to small. I finished my entree literally before half of the table got their food. Unlimited Thai Ice Teas were definitely a plus but not enough to cover for the mistakes made. So the worst part of the night had to be when after we paid our $1000 bill (emphasis on the $1000) we had some donuts we wanted to eat (for the Birthday Girl) but we were told that they would charge us if we ate our donuts. You got to understand, this is not a cake. We didn't ask you to store our cake. We didn't ask for plates or knives. Donuts aren't even messy. I wasn't mad at the fact that they wanted to charge us for bringing in outside food. I was more mad at the way they spoke to us after we ate one donut. They pretty much made a big scene and a big deal about it. Utterly disgusted. We just dropped $1000 on your restaurant at least show us a little respect. Never coming back to this place again. So many better restaurants in that area that give better service and better food. And yes. We did get charged for eating one donut.

Came here with a group of 20, with a prix fixe menu of $35 a person and we had the most difficult experience in my life. You can't even begin to imagine how disrespectful, rude and inconsiderate the manager was. Here are some quick hits of our experience: - 18 of the 20 people were present and the manager proceeded to count how many of us were actually there and wouldn't let us sit at the table. Even after explaining it was a surprise dinner, he did not care and would not let us sit... - As we were finishing our meal, we brought out doughnuts. We didn't ask for plates, just napkins and then we got a scolding. We actually got yelled at as if we were trying to run on the bill. ""You should know that no restaurant in the City lets you bring dessert in from outside."" Actually, you are incorrect as we just had a dinner the day before where we not only brought our own cake, but we weren't even charged. I can't even begin to tell you the other things he said, but never have I ever been spoken to like this at a restaurant and by a manager. - Not once did the manager come over to check on how we were doing or see how our meal was going. We were literally 20 people, with a set course so he knew how much we were going to spend. You'd think with such a hefty bill, you'd receive a little better service. On top of all of that, the food really wasn't that good. While the portion of the calamari was large for an appetizer, the food is very underwhelming. There wasn't enough curry in the massaman curry, my basil noodles weren't spicy and seemed to be coated in sugar and was a very small portion. Even with my tiny portion of food, I left this place with my stomach not feeling 100%. Needless to say, I will never come back to this place and I will be sure to tell everyone I know the say. We dropped $1K on this meal and received the worst service you could possibly imagine - this was the experience from hell. Do not EVER book a large party here.

They threatened to give our table away if they didn't show up in another 5 minutes. Completely ridiculous. After our meal, we brought dessert for a birthday celebration, and as we were about to eat it, we got scolded by the manager. We just gave them $1,000 worth of business, and the manager yelled at us like we were 5 years old for having dessert for our birthday party. This manager needs to be fired. Even the waiters apologized to us on his behalf as we were storming out. Food - There are way better thai restaurants out there. Try cafetasia, ngam, or any other restaurant for that matter. Pad thai was way too sweet. You're better off eating a bowl of sugar. Seafood noodles gave me diarrhea. Curry was bland. Duck was dry. Nobody in our group liked their food. It is pretty impressive that you can disappoint all 20 people in one party. Price - We spent about 50 dollars per person for terrible service and food. For that money, i would expect to be treated with respect, but instead, the power crazed manager treated us like garbage. You can get better thai food for a third of this price almost anywhere else. Conclusion - STAY AWAY FROM HERE unless you enjoy paying an excessive amounts of money for a night of scolding and diarrhea. FIRE THE MANAGER.

When we asked to move, the hostess disc the tables were reserved for other people. If it wasn't for the fact that I was starving, I would've stormed out. We got the avocado roll, duck salad and assorted gold fritters (spring rolls, fried tofu, fried shrimp, and shrimp with chicken dumplings) to start. Couldn't taste or find any avocado in the avocado roll. There were huge pieces of uncut lettuce in the salad. The gold fritters weren't bad and the fried tofu with sesame tasted like sesame candy. I ordered the massaman curry with beef and my friends got chicken and beef pad Thai. The pad Thai had a good flavor to it and the noodles had a good chewy texture. My massaman curry was ok, the beef was overcooked, nothing to write home about. After dinner, I was parched, from the MSG in the food. The wait staff were trying to kick us out. Every time we finished a dish, someone will quickly grab and clear the table. Some of the dishes were even empty and they took it off the table without asking if we were done. I found that super rude that they were rushing us out after we waited for 45 mins and practically dining in the cold. There was a breeze every time someone opened the door, even though there was a curtain to ""block the wind"". When we paid, we used 2 separate credit cards but they gave us 1 pen so my friend took out her pen to sign and the waiter was so efficient that he reached all the way across the table to take her pen while she was trying to put it in her purse! 2 stars for the food and decor and 0 stars for the service.

607147,44334,5026,3.0,1,2015-01-05,"This review is based only on my experience coming here for New Year's Day brunch. They offered the normal brunch menu, but allowed you to order any entree and any two drinks from the menu for $20.15. The first thing I noticed was the decor.  it's sultry, it's soft, it's edgy-somehow all at the same time. Bared concrete walls with hazy lights are somehow made sexy, a beautiful fountain cascades water down a wall, chains hang in scalloped fashion from the ceiling, and the colors work  perfectly together. I loved it. We were off to a good start- our waiter was friendly and funny, and the brunch menu looked fantastic. I started with a drink called DoNo coffee- cold brew (my favorite) with bourbon, kahlua and cream. It was very good, although a little rich because of cream. For food I ordered ""green eggs and ham"", which is their take on eggs benedict (the sauce is a basil hollandaise, hence the ""green"".  My date ordered the corned beef hash with eggs. Both came with cottage fries. The descriptions sounded marvelous! But, unfortunately the actual food ended up falling short both of the descriptions and our expectations. And while the service continued to be friendly, it was not super-attentive. I was supposed to get those 2 drinks included as part of the brunch special and had ordered the first right away and had it long before the food came--in fact it was almost gone when I was just starting to eat. This was not noticed and I was not asked if I would like a second drink until long after we were both finished eating, at which point I just wanted to get home. So I ended up sacrificing the second drink that was already paid for in my brunch special price, with just shrug of the waiter. The most surprising part of the experience, though, was that the english muffin halves that my green eggs and ham was on were so hard I literally could not cut them with a knife. I'm not joking- I don't use the word ""literally"" figuratively. The waiter noticed there was a problem because I was stabbing at them and laughing ridiculously- I couldn't help it. I could not fathom how an english muffin could have gotten has hard as a hockey puck.  This was not crispy- I was stabbing it vertically with a knife, trying to tear at it, trying just to bend it- and it was just clanking around my plate making a noise like concrete or dense plastic would.  The waiter came over and was equally shocked, and asked if he could bring them back to the kitchen to show them. After thinking about it, I realized they must have given me really, really stale english muffin halves, which was a bit offensive. The waiter ended up bringing me back a new english muffin a while later, and it was completely different. I realized the other one had shriveled to about half the size as this fresh one, and was wrinkly- things I didn't really notice at first. By the time the new english muffin halves came out, I had already been eating the egg and ham which I had slid off of them, so I didn't really end up eating them. I had also been making my way through some of the cottage fries, which were just crispy potatoes cut into wedges instead of fries. They were ok, but underwhelming since I had been expecting something extra tasty. The basil hollandaise sauce was OK, but nothing to write home about, and my dining companion ordered the corned beef hash and felt that it was only OK as well. Basically, a lot of ""OK"". I've heard great things about Dish and still want to come back and try some of the dinner dishes, but I'm still really surprised about the small things that made my first visit less than great. I'd probably give it two stars, to be honest, if it wasn't for the decor- the atmosphere and ambience were lovely enough to merit at least half a star.

After being chilled to the bone both literally and metaphorically at the Eastern State Penitentiary, and feeling the pangs of hunger for hours, my boyfriend and I stumbled into the beautifully welcoming restaurant. Conveniently located just across the street from the penitentiary, we ended up coming here for two lunches after beginning two days worth of photography adventuring. The door looks upscale despite having a casual feel. I would imagine it would be a great place to take your parents. Service at the bar was great and the brunch menu provided sounded very delicious. I had a large Irish coffee. The Short Rib Benedict. Generously portioned with a hefty side of greens and delicious! I'm always a sucker for short ribs on a menu and this did not disappoint. Lobster Grilled Cheese: The bread was beautifully toasted yet soft enough to bite into and had something of a cakey taste to it. There was a generous amount of lobster that mixed deliciously into the mozarella cheese, allowing the savoryness of the lobster to not be overpowered. It included a very large side salad. After having it I understood why it would be sold out the day before on our initial visit to the place. The value was good. You should definitely stop in.

The cocktails were reasonably priced especially for New Year's eve. My favorite was the bazzle-dazzle... Favorite 3 times in one night to be exact! I ordered the honey Dijon wings and a chicken taco which turned out to be a great food choice for me since it was made just right, and was not to dry like some which I've had before. In fact,. all the food was prepared pretty good and to high standards. Except maybe the crabcakes which were just ok and not really as flaky as maybe they could have been. But overall we thought the food was good and the only minor complaint I had was that I had wanted to try the lobster bisque but they were out of it at the time. So it must apparently be a popular food choice for many.   I also really liked how the DJ played a variety of music for ALL age groups especially for us 'seasoned' people. Other plaes I've gone have played ONLY rap or hip-hop or other music which is typically geared for a much younger age group. But the DJ played music which would be enjoyed by everyone of all age groups and backgrounds. He even squeezed in our personal request for what else, but Celebration by Kool & the Gang to ring in 2015! (Not at exactly midnight which would have certainly been ideal , but close enough anyways to still make it count.

I went for their burger special (burger by guest chef in the city or in house, fries or salad, beer and shot of buffalo trace) for $15!!!! This deal is insane. I thought that perhaps the burger would be small or the beer would be tiny since it was so cheap - instead, you get a huge meal. It's amazing. Burger was outstanding. Fries were perfect. I also shared a mussel like dish that was outstanding. Service was also spot - on. Our waiter was funny, clever, and very knowledgeable on the food being served. I will definitely be coming back! I recently went on a trip to New Orleans and Rex seemed right out of the French Quarter. They should try to line up some live jazz and the place would really be a hit!

But while I expected Rex 1516 to deliver a win for somewhat biased reasons since my friend Jake works the kitchen, and that it would be the perfect spot for myself and couple friends to enjoy a holiday reunion; I wasn't prepared for the little touches that delivered big results. And those things make Rex the perfect place to give my first 5 star review of 2015 to! Sitting barside during a packed Saturday meant that our main server was also an incredible mixologist who was spot on with his beer recommendations. The Deep South cocktail with rooibos infused vodka, honey syrup, lemon, and Bartram's bitters was perfectly crafted and delivered the right elements to sooth the claws of the throat wolf that the weather had me enduring. When a patron was gluten free they were given a whole other menu of options. When someone asked for a soda they were given Mexican cola by the bottle instead of whatever crap comes out of the gun. Its little things like that which just took their service and attentiveness to another level without being obtrusive. For appetizers we split the smoked wings with chipotle molasses glaze, incredible crawfish pot pie with a spicy crawfish etouffee, and fried green tomatoes that are easily the best in Philly. While the hamburger with fried egg, bacon, and pimento cheese with sweet potato fries; and the southern fried chicken meal with collards, Andoiulle cornbread stuffing, and black pepper chicken gravy gave my friends satisfying meat comas; I decided that I needed some fish. And the Bienville Pan Roast  with littleneck clams, mussels, and Scottish samon fish of the day with a flavorful sauce and plenty of sourdough to soak it up in delivered perfect results. Hitting up their brunch so that I can try their Best of Philly winning huevos rancheros is definitely on my list. But I also plan on catching some of their game changing Citywide  Burger Specials of the week since they've been coming up with some amazing ones.

Apparently on holidays a lot of delivery places are not open. After some searching we found that Andy's Pizza was open. Now normally this is not my go to as their pizza leaves much to be desired. We ordered a chicken ceasar wrap, a bbq wrap, onion rings, and mozz sticks. All pretty safe things to order from a pizza place or so we thought. The bbq chicken wrap didn't even have bbq sauce rather some pink almost tasting like teriyaki sauce (gag). The chicken ceasar wrap had soggy lettuce that was brown and no ceasar dressing. The onion rings had so much batter that even those were not enjoyable. Now mozz sticks from a pizza restaurant should at least be hot and crispy not these; these were soggy and cold.  Obviously we immediately regretted our decision by ordering from here.
