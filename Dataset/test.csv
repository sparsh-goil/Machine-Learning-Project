154278,2345,5.0,1,2015-01-03,"i recently went to papas pizza after nearly  years after recently moving back to the east coast my family reached our destination of a new restaurant that has an above average vibe on the outside than the previous joint who remembers papas old spot in trenton if you do not then you are not worthy of giving this place any bad reviews first things first i greatly dislike crowded places and i make it a lifetime goal to avoid crowds i would have taken the pizza to go through the side door but i was with a group and out voted  so new spot and classy vibe its no olive garden but who cares about some tour of italy this was real italy here but that did not help me maintain my nerves i was nervous and trenching in sweat while rockin my ugly xmas sweater underneath a brown leather jacket that i was too nervous to take off my attire was ready for a snow storm but either way my group stood out like a sore thumb i could not help but notice that the spot felt a little crammed the service was slightly slow but come on its a family business not a franchise and the place was at max occupancy with a couple groups leaving and more lingering around to be seated after a few minutes we received our drinks and homemade group salad i vividly remember the yams and the moderate salad that had my mind pacing i was anxious for the pizza and my stomach was roaring like a lion i am hungry and the salad was not going to do my mind was second guessing even entering this place i looked around and my group were just as anxious for the next thing to come it took a few minutes but then the music changed and classical italian music was in effect all of suddenly the place seemed to get dark and it felt like heavens light fell upon uour table as the waitress with a slight unnoticeable attitude brought the pizza and placed it on the holy grail on our table then a slight war broke out as my group of barbarians were fighting for the pizza as if it was the last piece food for the winter english escaped our minds as were speaking caveman talk to figure out who will get the slice with the most sauce but nothing could explain what happened next i received my slice of pizza and humanity entered my soul as i realized that this has to be eaten with love and joy again the room went dark and i was already halfway between the pizza and my mouth i never felt this was before about pizza since i last binged on papas nearly a decade ago all the butterflies in my stomach were gone and the lights were brazing on my head as if i was on stage in front of millions as soon as i went in for the first bite the room went completely empty never in my life had i felt this way i was actually enjoying food in a crowded place without even realizing the crowd around me could it be possible that papas helped me with a fear i never wanted to acknowledge hold up this has to be a joke or so i thought i was done with my first slice and hastily went for a second this second one would prove that all of this was a lie behold life again disappeared from any visual existence and only thing around was my second slice and the music is this really happening i entered a state of nirvana but then it was over when i came crashing back to earth who am i was a question that pondered my mind as i was looking around for a third slice i quickly clenched a fork in my hand as my animal instincts were pounding through my chest thinking of ways to eliminate the members of my group by means of survival of the fittest all of this for the last slice of pizzai could not help to notice the others were also clenching their forks in the same manner we quickly came back to humanity and made the choice to order another large pizza however our animal instincts quickly kicked back in as we were howling and growling while trying to get the waitress back to our table we waited then waited some more until we got the second pizza to go we tipped the waitress a fair sum of money but not a normal big tip since we felt that it was her fault for depriving us of such godly food then we charged out of the door as if we were participating in the running of the bulls and the rest was history dela who papa what domi nooo the point is that pizza is pizza its an art that should be appreciated for its style i have had pizza all over and even in northern italy from a shack stand on a dirt road some will like pizza cheesy or extra sauce crispy or undercooked meat or just a tomato pie chicago pizza bbq pizza california pizza and even mexican pizza theres no such thing as the best pizza but appreciating art at its finest is priceless and this pizza is priceless
